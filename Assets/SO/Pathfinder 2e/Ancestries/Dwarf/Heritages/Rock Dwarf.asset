  description: "Your ancestors lived and worked among the great ancient\r stones
    of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This\r makes you solid as a rock
    when you plant your feet. You\r gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude
    or Reflex\r DC against attempts to Shove or Trip you. This bonus\r also applies
    to saving throws against spells or effects that\r attempt to knock you prone.\r
    In addition, if any effect would force you to move 10\r feet or more, you are
    moved only half the distance."
