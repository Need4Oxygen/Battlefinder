  description: "You have a knack for noticing even small inconsistencies and\r craftsmanship
    techniques in the stonework around you. You\r gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
    Perception checks to notice\r unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks
    to discover\r mechanical traps made of stone or hidden within stone.\r\nIf you
    aren\u2019t using the Seek action or searching, the GM\r automatically rolls
    a secret check for you to notice unusual\r stonework anyway. This check doesn\u2019t
    gain the circumstance\r bonus, and it takes a \u20132 circumstance penalty."
