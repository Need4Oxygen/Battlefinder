  description: "You\u2019ve learned techniques first devised by your ancestors\r
    during their ancient wars, allowing you to comfortably wear\r massive suits of
    armor. Ignore the reduction to your Speed\r from any armor you wear.\r\nIn addition,
    any time you\u2019re taking a penalty to your Speed\r from some other reason
    (such as from the encumbered\r condition or from a spell), deduct 5 feet from
    the penalty.\r\nFor example, the encumbered condition normally gives a\r \u201310-foot
    penalty to Speed, but it gives you only a \u20135-foot\r penalty. If your Speed
    is taking multiple penalties, pick only\r one penalty to reduce."
