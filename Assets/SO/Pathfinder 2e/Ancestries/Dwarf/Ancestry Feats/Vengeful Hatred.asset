  title: Vengeful Hatred
  feat: 7
  level: 1
  description: "You heart aches for vengeance against those who have\r wronged your
    people. Choose one of the following dwarven\r ancestral foes when you gain Vengeful
    Hatred: drow, duergar,\r giant, or orc. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage\r
    with weapons and unarmed attacks against creatures with\r that trait. If your
    attack would deal more than one weapon die\r of damage (as is common at higher
    levels than 1st), the bonus\r is equal to the number of weapon dice or unarmed
    attack dice.\r\nIn addition, if a creature critically succeeds at an attack\r
    against you and deals damage to you, you gain your bonus\r to damage against
    that creature for 1 minute regardless of\r whether it has the chosen trait.\r\nSpecial
    Your GM can add appropriate creature traits to the\r ancestral foes list if your
    character is from a community that commonly fights other types of enemies."
