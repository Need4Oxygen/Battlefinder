  description: "Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving\r across
    uneven surfaces. You can ignore difficult terrain caused\r by rubble and uneven
    ground made of stone and earth.\r\nIn addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill
    to Balance on\r narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you\r
    aren\u2019t flat-footed, and when you roll a success at one of these\r Acrobatics
    checks, you get a critical success instead."
