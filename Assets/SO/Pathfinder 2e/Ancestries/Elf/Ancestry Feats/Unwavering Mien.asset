  description: "Your mystic control and meditations allow you to resist\r external
    influences upon your consciousness. Whenever you\r are affected by a mental effect
    that lasts at least 2 rounds, you\r can reduce the duration by 1 round.\r\nYou
    still require natural sleep, but you treat your saving\r throws against effects
    that would cause you to fall asleep as\r one degree of success better. This protects
    only against sleep\r effects, not against other forms of falling unconscious."
