  description: 'You dwell deep in the frozen north and have gained incredible resilience
    against cold

    environments, granting you cold resistance equal to half your
    level (minimum 1). You

    treat environmental cold effects as if they were
    one step less extreme (incredible cold

    becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes
    severe, and so on).'
