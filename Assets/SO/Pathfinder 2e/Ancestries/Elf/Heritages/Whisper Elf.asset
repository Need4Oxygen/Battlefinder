  description: "Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest\r whispers
    of sound. As long as you can hear normally, you\r can use the Seek action to
    sense undetected creatures in\r a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You
    also gain\r a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures\r that you
    could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action."
