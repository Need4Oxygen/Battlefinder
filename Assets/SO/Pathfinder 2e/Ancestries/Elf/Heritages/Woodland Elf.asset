  description: "You\u2019re adapted to life in the forest or the deep jungle,\r and
    you know how to climb trees and use foliage to your\r advantage. When Climbing
    trees, vines, and other foliage,\r you move at half your Speed on a success and
    at full\r Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed\r on a success
    if you have Quick Climb). This doesn\u2019t affect\r\nyou if you\u2019re using
    a climb Speed.\r\nYou can always use the Take Cover action when you\r are within
    forest terrain to gain cover, even if you\u2019re not\r next to an obstacle you
    can Take Cover behind."
