description: 'Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where
  they prey upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes
  encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is
  thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are famous
  for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near them,
  which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to instantly
  teleport across the battlefield.
