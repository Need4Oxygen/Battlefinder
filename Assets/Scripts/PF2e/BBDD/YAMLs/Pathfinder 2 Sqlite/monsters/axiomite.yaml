description: 'According to the axiomites, their kind rose from the raw mathematical
  underpinnings of the universe, manifesting as great builders who created the ancient,
  colossal cities of the Outer Planes and gave life to the mechanical inevitables.
  According to the aeons, axiomites are part of the Monad, having both risen from
  and rebelled against it long ago. Since the Convergence, most axiomites have recognized
  this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons showed the axiomites how
  the Utopian language has formed as an amalgam of aeon envisioning and formulaic
  mathematical expression. Most axiomites live in the perfect city of Axis, which
  they continually act to improve, thus refining the concept of perfection itself.




  A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid creature, though the particular
  form it takes on does not affect its abilities. Beneath this assumed form, all axiomites
  are the sameâ€”clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirls and congeals
  into complex tangles of symbols and equations, evincing their existence as literal
  creatures of pure mathematical law.




  Axiomites arise from the souls of lawful neutral mortals, particularly those who
  were, in life, mathematicians, architects, crafters, or philosophers. While these
  souls do not retain any memories of their lives in the transition into axiomites,
  their life skills and experiences nevertheless serve a valuable metaphysical resource
  during formation.
