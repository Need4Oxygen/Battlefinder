description: 'These blobs of nearly transparent protoplasm are identical in form and
  behavior to the microscopic creatures from which they have evolved, except their
  outlandish size makes them all the more dangerous. Unlike slimes, puddings, and
  other deadly oozes, giant amoebas have an outer membrane that contains their internal
  structures, making them more susceptible to slashing weapons than their amorphous
  kin. However, this membrane is also extremely flexible and permeable, allowing them
  to surround prey and absorb it, suffocating and slowly digesting it in the amoeba''s
  acidic fluids.
