description: 'These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps,
  marshes, or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or patches of
  wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims to reach down for a drink or
  step into what appears to be a puddle, then lash out with whiplike pseudopods to
  ensnare and consume their hapless prey.
