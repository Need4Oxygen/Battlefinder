description: 'Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon''s
  head. Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level
  of intelligence. They can speak __Draconic__ (with a thick, hissing accent), but
  their ability to reason is limited and they can''t use magic. They do possess a
  level of cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and
  even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don''t expect to find a tatzlwyrm
  sitting atop a bed of coins.




  Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons, though
  it''s a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as messengers
  (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due to their smaller
  size), guides (when they''re familiar with a particular mountain), and even muscle
  (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon''s direct attention).




  Tatzlwyrms don''t work with __kobolds__, thoughâ€”tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.




  Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they
  seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable
  occasion, townsfolk reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict
  between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars
  still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or
  if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who
  were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.




  When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they
  sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales'' natural camouflage
  and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor
  into an opponent''s face. Since this breath attack doesn''t have much range, the
  wyrms usually need to grab their foes first and bring them close to their mouth.
