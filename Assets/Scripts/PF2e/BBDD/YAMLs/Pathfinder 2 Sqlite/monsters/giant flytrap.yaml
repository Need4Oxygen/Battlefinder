  description: The flytrap attacks a single target with all four of its leaves. The
    flytrap makes one leaf Strike. On a success, the flytrap deals the damage from
    one leaf Strike plus an additional 1d8 damage for every leaf beyond the first.
    On a failure, the flytrap deals the damage from one leaf Strike, but it can't
    use Improved Grab. It deals no damage on a critical failure. This counts toward
    the flytrap's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number
    of leaves the flytrap has.
