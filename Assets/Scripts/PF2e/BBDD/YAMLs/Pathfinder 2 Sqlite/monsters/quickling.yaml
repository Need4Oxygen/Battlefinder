description: 'Few creatures can match a quickling''s speed. These malicious fey creatures
  delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash
  at foes before scampering away for cover with maddening— even frightening—swiftness.
  Stories of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously
  opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks.




  Quicklings actively hate the "slow-paced dullards" they encounter every day, delighting
  in inflicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to matter.
  While they are related to kinder fey such as __brownies__ and __pixies__, quicklings
  care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height
  of humor and have full confidence that their speed and invisibility will keep them
  safe from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although
  the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform
  increasingly deadly pranks against each other.
