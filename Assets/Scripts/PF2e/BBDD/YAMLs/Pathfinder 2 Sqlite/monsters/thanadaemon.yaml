description: 'Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons represent death via
  old age. They are among the most patient daemons, and prefer to bide their time
  to enact far-reaching, decades-long plans rather than fight (though they are still
  deadly foes). Like the Horseman of Death, they ply the waters of the River Styx
  in search of wayward souls. Rarely are thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar
  (which they wield as a __bo staff__), a tool they use to navigate the river''s muck-ridden
  channels and turbulent rapids.
