description: 'Nearly a myth, the yeti is rarely seenâ€”and even when it is, it is often
  too late. Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down
  from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed their
  insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the foot
  of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the "abominable snowmen": monstrous, fur-covered
  humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow.




  Normally yetis seek to protect the world rather than hunt its other civilized denizens.
  They do so by lairing near eldritch portals that form links between the Material
  Plane and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within these snow-covered
  arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares, fiends, and worse
  can emerge through dimensional networks into the world. Yetis who guard these portals
  sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted, taking on the bloodthirsty
  urges and horrific behaviors of the very monsters they strive to protect the world
  against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies are driven out of their clan
  and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus giving rise to the myth of the
  legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend for themselves, these exiled yetis
  often fully embrace the corrupting elements that caused their exile in the first
  place, growing more powerful and more deadly as a result. The most vile of these
  yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but out of a sheer joy at the terror
  they inflict upon their kin. Invariably such cannibalistic yetis attract the attention
  of wendigos, which makes a bad situation all the worse.
