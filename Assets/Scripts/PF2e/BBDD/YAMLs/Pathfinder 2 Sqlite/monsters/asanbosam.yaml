description: 'Asanbosams are monstrous, hairy humanoids with cold iron fangs and muscular
  limbs that end in powerful, hooked claws. They hide in treetops and grab prey from
  above, latching onto their unfortunate victims'' necks to drain their blood. Locals
  in nearby communities tell horror stories of these "bloodsucking tree-folk," and
  experienced jungle explorers keep a close watch on the treetops in asanbosam territory.




  An asanbosam''s diet calls for a large amount of iron (typically in the form of
  blood) to maintain the integrity of its oversized cold iron teeth. When not hunting
  or mating, an asanbosam spends its waking hours chewing on certain types of rocks
  to sharpen its teeth.




  Some folk tales claim that asanbosams are as old as time and are the original source
  of cold iron, and that veins of the metal found in the ground are the buried graveyards
  of ancient asanbosams. Brave (or foolish) poachers often infiltrate asanbosam territory
  to hunt these monsters in the hope of collecting sacks of their valuable teeth.

    __restrained__, __unconscious__, or willing creature is within reach of the asanbosam''s
    jaws. **Effect** The asanbosam sinks its teeth into the creature to drink its
    blood. If the victim is grabbed, this is automatic; otherwise, the asanbosam must
    succeed at an __Athletics__ check against the victim''s Fortitude DC. The victim
    becomes __drained 1__ and the asanbosam regains 10 HP, gaining any excess HP as
    temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that''s already drained increases
    the victim''s drained value by 1, but doesn''t restore any HP to the asanbosam.


    A victim''s drained condition decreases by 1 each week. A blood transfusion, which
    requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and a blood donor or sufficient blood,
    reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.'
