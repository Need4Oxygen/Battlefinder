  description: If a creature critically succeeds on a check to __Trip__ the giant
    crab, the crab is flipped over onto its back in addition to the usual effects.
    A giant crab that is flipped onto its back has a particularly hard time defending
    itself; instead of taking the normal -2 circumstance penalty to AC for being __flat-footed__,
    it takes a -4 circumstance penalty to AC.

description: 'Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic
  sideways gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and fight other
  crabs for territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most
  crabs prefer to flee, but when retreat isn''t possible, they clamp on to their foes
  as tightly as they can.




  The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water''s
  surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations
  to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain
  darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of
  the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.




  These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size makes
  them dangerous targets for harvesting.
