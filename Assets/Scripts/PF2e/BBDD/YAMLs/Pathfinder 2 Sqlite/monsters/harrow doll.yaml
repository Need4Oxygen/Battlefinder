description: 'Harrow dolls are unique constructs that can make predictions about the
  future. The more elite circuses and traveling shows frequently feature a harrow
  doll, and many use the doll''s abilities to learn more about locals to better customize
  shows to their tastesâ€”or to find easy marks for later cons. Upset patrons that try
  to harm a harrow doll or reclaim their payment quickly learn that the construct
  is more than capable of defending itself.

  description: 'A creature struck by one of the harrow doll''s cards must attempt
