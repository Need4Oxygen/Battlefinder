  description: When the sand sentry takes fire or lightning damage, its outer layer
    of sand fuses into sheets of hardened glass for 1 minute. This increases the sand
    sentry's AC to 26 and grants it resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire,
    force, piercing, and slashing damage. A sand sentry can't use earth glide while

description: 'Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a
  muted and featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie
  grace. The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over
  an area of great importanceâ€”these elementals are patient participants in such roles,
  making them well suited for long-term service.
