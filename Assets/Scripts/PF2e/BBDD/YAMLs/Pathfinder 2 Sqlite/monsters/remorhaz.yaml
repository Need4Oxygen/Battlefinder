description: 'A remorhaz is an enormous arctic predator that resembles a multilegged
  insect with draconic features. This monster has chitinous plates and more than a
  score segmented legs, a multipartite maw, and winglike growths fianking its head.
  The most unusual aspect of the creature, however, is its internal heat, which burns
  with such intensity that it causes the armored plates on the creature''s back to
  become superheated whenever the beast is agitated.




  Remorhazes are carnivores. Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but a
  hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly lurks
  beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many victims
  die before even knowing what attacked them.




  Those who survive the worm''s initial onslaught must face not only its deadly jaws,
  but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn
  fleshâ€”all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz''s
  internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth
  tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage.
  Most people underestimate a remorhaz''s intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal.
  However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular
  use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection,
  and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps
  the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons. The giants also employ the
  worms as war beasts, using them to undermine enemy positions.
