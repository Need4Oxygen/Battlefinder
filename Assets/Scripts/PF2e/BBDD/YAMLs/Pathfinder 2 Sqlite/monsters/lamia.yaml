description: 'Just as they were cursed long ago, lamias can curse those they touch,
  clouding the mind and regressing conscious thought to purely animalistic instincts.
  Creatures affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences
  of their own actions and unable to think clearly. This makes the hapless victim
  all the more susceptible to the lamia''s cunning illusions and insidious charms.
  The lamia''s animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch has led some
  scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away
  from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether
  this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Lamashtu or inflicted as a curse
  for abandoning their responsibilities by Pharasma remains the subject of debate
  to this day.




  Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias themselves have grown
  to enjoy the strengths it has granted them. Regardless, they continue to cling to
  a hatred of the gods, seeing them as the cause of their monstrous forms and, thus,
  their eternal exile from the societies they watch with jealous eyes from their lairs
  amid the ruins of lost civilizations. Because lamias blame divine powers for their
  curse, they take special delight in the downfall of temples, the suffering and death
  of champions and clerics, and the spread of dissension within organized religions.




  While they can brie  y assume humanoid form with magic, lamias are usually forced
  to hide from civilization, making their homes in the barren wilderness. There, they
  attract cults of their own, gathering up chaotic and evil humanoids. With the help
  of these cultists, lamias strive to bring down popular faiths, introduce schisms
  into flourishing churches, and humiliate or defame high-profile religious leaders.
  Most lamias themselves have no true religious faith in anything, hearing instead
  a mystical calling that manifests as sighs on the desert wind or murmurs from the
  dark places between the stars.




  Lamias are traditionally matriarchal, revering the eldest female among them as leader,
  mother, and shaman.
