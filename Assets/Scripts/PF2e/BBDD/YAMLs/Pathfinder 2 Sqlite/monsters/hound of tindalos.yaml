description: 'Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper
  with the flow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs
  to send their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters
  can draw them from the __Dimension of Time__ via rare rituals, but doing so attracts
  the hounds'' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread
  their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they
  rarely interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have
  attracted their unblinking attention.




  Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The
  pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays
  and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds
  of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.
