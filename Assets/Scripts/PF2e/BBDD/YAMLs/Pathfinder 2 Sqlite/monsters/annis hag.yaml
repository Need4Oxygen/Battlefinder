description: 'Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical
  screams and tasty flesh of young creatures and those who are pure of heart. Annis
  hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat and using their
  change shape ability to hunt rather than to infiltrate and betray humanoids. But
  an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses it to sow discord, sending
  the trophy to one of her victim''s loved ones in a way that implicates another family
  member in the murder. Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet flexible
  flesh that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron that
  burns the flesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to the leadership
  of hag covens.
