description: 'Swelling like a bubble about to burst, this oozing thing looks like
  it is made entirely from blood. Its slick, crimson skin is marred only by spots
  that look like clots formed on the surface.




  Created through the foulest of alchemical rituals, the blood ooze seeks only one
  thing: to increase its mass by consuming blood from the living. The blood ooze hides
  within the body of its victims, only bursting out to attack when another meal draws
  near, leaving the body a husk of its former self.




  The process by which such an ooze is created involves draining the blood of at least
  four Medium creatures and feeding all of the collected blood to a fifth creature,
  along with deadly reagents designed to prevent the blood from coagulating. During
  this time, the host slowly dies while the blood ooze takes form, emerging 2 to 6
  hours later. Blood oozes have no loyalty toward those who created them, but some
  creators have noted that newly formed blood oozes seem to avoid harming other members
  of the host creature''s family.




  It is not widely known that an existing blood ooze can reproduce by splitting itself
  in half. It undergoes this division only if it has grown so large that splitting
  in half would create a pair of normal-sized blood oozes, such as the one listed
  below.
