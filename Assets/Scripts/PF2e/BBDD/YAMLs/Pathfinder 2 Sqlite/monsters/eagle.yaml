description: 'These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch
  fish and small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or
  steep cliffs that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid
  nesting too near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting
  companions.
