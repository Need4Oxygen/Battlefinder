description: 'Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals
  with long, animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural affinity and admiration
  for stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest
  or wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don''t take
  kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who
  stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their
  minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to flow freely, often wearing only
  a belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shearsâ€”though this belt and
  pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.
