description: 'Some serpentfolk undergo intense ritual training and practice to improve
  their innate ability to disguise themselves. These serpentfolk often identify as
  members of a sinister society known as the Coils of __Ydersius__, and the most devoted
  of their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more efficiently
  infiltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme step, they
  must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in methods of infiltrating
  other societies to such an extent that they might be capable of infiltrating a mammalian
  civilization for years. Though they''re expected to work entirely toward the eventual
  triumph of their people, most Coil spies also find personal pursuits to keep them
  occupied in the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it''s rarely due to a
  lack of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they pursue
  their hedonistic desires.
