description: 'These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality
  of guard dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands
  under their scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts
  of lightning strong enough to harm significantly larger foes. Though they''re meek
  and docile when encountered alone, shocker lizards are significantly more aggressive
  in packs, when they can amplify each other''s electrical attacks.




  Shocker lizards are notoriously difficult to domesticate because they''re dangerously
  hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept alone in
  captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and weighs
  25 pounds.
