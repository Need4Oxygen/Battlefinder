  description: A grindylow gains 1 extra reaction at the start of each of its turns
    that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity with a tentacle. It can't
    use more than one Attack of Opportunity triggered by the same choice.
  effect: You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against
    the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was
    a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward
    your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to
    this Strike.

description: 'The top half of a grindylow looks vaguely like that of a goblin, but
  from the waist down, their bodies split into a tangle of suckered, wriggling tentacles.
  They dwell mostly in shallow waters both fresh and briny, including lakes, rivers,
  coastal regions, and near coral reefs. Grindylows generally organize into schools
  ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be
  brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances
  last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving grindylows
  scatter and form smaller schools of their own.




  Grindylows aren''t territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build
  permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until
  driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso
  of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters
  that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.




  Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for
  squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested
  waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of
  warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can
  also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack;
  this becomes especially more likely if the ship''s route becomes predictable. This
  hatred of squids does not extend to other tentacled creatures; grindylows consider
  octopuses to be the epitome of grace and power.
