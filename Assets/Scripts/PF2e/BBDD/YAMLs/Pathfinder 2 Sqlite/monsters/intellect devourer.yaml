description: 'Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and infiltrators for the
  powerful force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters
  roam the Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When
  an intellect devourer infiltrates a society, its first priority is to acquire a
  body. It might first seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier
  than fighting and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the
  host''s brain cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the
  nervous system of its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit
  a new body to make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic
  animal.

  description: The intellect devourer reduces in size and burrows into the brain of

    could. Any effect that ends the possession kills the host body with the same effects
    as Exit Body. The intellect devourer can't use any of the host creature's spells
