description: 'Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used
  as guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses
  upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these
  oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little
  basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble
  clay golems even in the slightest.




  The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem
  prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally
  ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their
  golems are maintained and in good working orderâ€”or otherwise place them on the other
  side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.
