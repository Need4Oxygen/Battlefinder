description: 'Succubi are manifestations of the sin of destructive lust, and they
  are the most attractive of all demonsâ€”as befits their role in seducing mortals to
  fall to sin. The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless
  humanoid forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine
  true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind
  of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or
  handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.




  When disguised as a mortal humanoid on the Material Plane, a succubus whispers into
  the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires
  and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals
  often fixate on succubi''s application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily
  exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal
  appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies makes them excellent spies, assassins,
  and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending
  mortal culture.
