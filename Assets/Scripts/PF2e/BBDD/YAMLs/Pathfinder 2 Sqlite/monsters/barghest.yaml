description: 'Typical barghests are ravenous gluttons of life who feed and grow on
  the fat of mortals, their bodies changing in ways none can predict as they use the
  flesh and blood of their victims to achieve grisly transformations into greater
  barghests. Barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to rule tribes
  of goblinoids or to discreetly hunt in rural areas in the guise of unnaturally intelligent
  wolves. They do not work well together, as each barghest wants all the kills for
  itself; cannibalism is the typical result of too many barghests in one small area.
