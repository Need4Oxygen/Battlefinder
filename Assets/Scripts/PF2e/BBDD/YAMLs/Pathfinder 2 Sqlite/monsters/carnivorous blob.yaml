  description: When a carniverous blob that has 10 or more HP is hit by an attack
    that would deal piercing or slashing damage, it splits into two identical oozes,
    each with half the original's HP. One ooze is in the same space as the original,
    and the other is in an adjacent, unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied,
    it automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the
    GM decides if an object or creature is too big or heavy to push).

description: 'Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond
  the stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites
  onto unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant for years in desolate
  caverns or barren wastelands. When a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures
  nearby, it lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming every creature
  it can catch until it is destroyed or until it has been unable to locate food for
  24 hours, at which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping food away from
  a carnivorous blob is the safest way to defeat it. The blob''s ability to split
  into smaller oozes that might stay hidden after a fight means it can be hard to
  fully eradicate these mindless predators.
