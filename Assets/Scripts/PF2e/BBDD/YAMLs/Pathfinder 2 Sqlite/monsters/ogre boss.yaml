description: 'In ogre society, might makes more than rightâ€”it makes the rules. The
  strongest or most violent ogre in a family (in most cases, this is the same ogre)
  is invariably that family''s boss. Quick to hook fallen foes on their weapons, even
  other ogres fear the repercussions of displeasing an ogre boss. When an ogre boss
  barks out commands, the other members of the family move quickly to obey.
