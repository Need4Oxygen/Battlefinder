description: 'Sea hags kill and eat fishers and sailors who come near their lairs,
  torment coastal dwellers with dark promises and vague threats, and enjoy the act
  of causing distress and discord in small towns. They generally avoid making their
  lairs too close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes.
  Sea hags are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains,
  deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their voracious
  appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated, and unlike more powerful hags, they
  lack the ability to magically disguise their form.




  Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature often prevents them from joining
  mixed covens with other kinds of hags.
