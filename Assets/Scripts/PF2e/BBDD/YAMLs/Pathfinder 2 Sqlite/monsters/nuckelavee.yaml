description: 'When pollution despoils a natural waterway, it draws the dreaded nuckelavee
  to it from the __First World__. This spirit of wrath is a grisly sight to behold:
  a horselike monstrosity with the gnarled upper body of a humanoid growing directly
  from its back. Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the
  misshapen hybrid form, as though it survived its own flaying.




  When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction
  across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the cruelest
  and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those who would
  befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn''t discriminate between
  those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune to be in the wrong place
  at the wrong time.
