  description: 30 feet, DC 33. Swirling winds of noxious, flammable gas surround a
    muurfeli. An open flame, spark, or similar fire effect in the area causes an explosion
    that deals 20d6 fire damage to all creatures in the aura (including the muurfeli)
    and temporarily disables the aura for 1 minute. When the muurfeli takes damage
    from an ability with the __water__ trait or fails a saving throw against a water
    effect, their firedamp winds aura is disabled for 1 minute. A creature that enters
    or begins its turn in the aura must attempt a Fortitude save.
