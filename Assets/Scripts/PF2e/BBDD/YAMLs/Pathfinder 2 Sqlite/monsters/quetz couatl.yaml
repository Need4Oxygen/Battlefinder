description: 'These sacred feathered serpents tirelessly serve the powers of law and
  good. Some operate directly as messengers and intermediaries of the deities, while
  others operate independently in aiding the cause of righteousness. Either way, they
  watch over mortals and try to influence and aid them from the shadows, shifting
  from plane to plane to spread wisdom and healing where they are needed. Some quetz
  couatls are worshipped as divinities in remote or isolated societies, and while
  they do not encourage such veneration, they use the trust placed in them to foster
  peace and cooperation with others.




  Quetz couatls are typically 10 to 20 feet long, with iridescent blue and green scales.
  Their glorious wings of rainbow-hued feathers span 15 feet and weigh nearly a ton.
  They are carnivorous, feeding on birds, mammals, and even the occasional evil __humanoid__.
