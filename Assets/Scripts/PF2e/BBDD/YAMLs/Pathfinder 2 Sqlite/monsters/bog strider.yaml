description: "The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no\
  \ offense at those who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble\
  \ upright water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders\
  \ can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or fleeing from predators\
  \ across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they call home.\
  \ Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. \n\n\n\nA bog\
  \ strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed only\
  \ on animals, as they consider the consumption of the flesh of any sapient creature\
  \ a taboo.\n\n\n\nIn sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally\
  \ in all efforts to ensure the society's survival against the more aggressive creatures\
  \ often found in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the\
  \ community is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity,\
  \ and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female\
  \ bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers,\
  \ but often such roles aren't limited to a single gender, as every member of a small\
  \ community pitches in to help as they can.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Aberration__\
