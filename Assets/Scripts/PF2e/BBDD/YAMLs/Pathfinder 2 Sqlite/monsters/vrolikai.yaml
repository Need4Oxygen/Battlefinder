description: 'Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn''t form from a sinful
  soulâ€”they instead manifest from a __nabasu__ once the nabasu finally satisfies their
  hunger and returns to the __Abyss__, and as such vrolikais suffer from no vulnerability
  associated with a specific sin. A vrolikai who survives this process and the period
  of vulnerability that follows gains great power and in time can claim large regions
  of the Abyss as their own domain. Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters
  often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.

  description: The vrolikai attacks a single target with all of its black flame knives.
    The demon makes a black flame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the vrolikai
    deals the damage from a black flame knife Strike to the target, plus an additional
    2d6 negative damage for every black flame knife they wield beyond the first (typically
    6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack, the vrolikai deals the damage from
    one black flame knife to the target, though they still miss completely on a critical
    failure. On a critical hit, the victim becomes __drained 2__ as the focused attack
    drains pure life essence as well as damage. This counts toward the vrolikai's
    multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of black flame
    knives the demon wields.
