description: 'Ghaeles are fiend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom
  to take up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly
  in mortal wars, but where fiends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might
  assume the guise of a mortal to fight fiends alongside others, hoping to bolster
  morale and teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various
  deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an affinity for Cayden Cailean
  in his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among
  azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving
  problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.
