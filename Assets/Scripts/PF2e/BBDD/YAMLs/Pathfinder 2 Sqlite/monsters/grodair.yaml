description: 'Grodairs are bizarre fishlike creature native to the First World. Their
  supernatural physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space
  capable of storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability
  to create a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water,
  quickly transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish
  to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When necessary,
  grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long, fleshy tentacles
  that dangle from their bellies.




  Grodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes the
  creatures difficult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During conversations,
  they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difficulty remembering things.
  Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing tales about the world.
  While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they aren''t reliable. They have
  difficulty following plans or schedules, and they can keep a secret only if they
  happen to forget it first. For these reasons, grodairs don''t always make the best
  allies.




  Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foodsâ€”in fact,
  the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that they venture
  out of First World. They can also capture and store within their throats any small
  animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them for consumption at
  a later time.
