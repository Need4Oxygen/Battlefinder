description: 'A voracious, flesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous
  blossom arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses
  the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system,
  it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act
  that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper
  vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this
  effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.




  Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through
  ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag
  itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary
  sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited
  tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.




  The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured
  remains of victims. It''s not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals,
  ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant''s immediate vicinity, along
  with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A viper vine
  rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier, preferring to hunt
  fresh meat.
