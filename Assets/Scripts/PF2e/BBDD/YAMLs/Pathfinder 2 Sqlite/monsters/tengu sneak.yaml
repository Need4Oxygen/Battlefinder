description: 'Crow-like humanoids, tengus are a canny and clever people who can be
  found across all of Golarion. Tengus are used to being minorities and facing suspicion
  wherever they travel, so by necessity many possess a knack for languages as well
  as for blades. They live on the fringes of society and tend to flock toward less-than-legal
  occupations, earning them their reputation for being streetwise and unscrupulousâ€”a
  label that, in turn, perpetuates the tengus'' oppressive cycle of discrimination
  and illegitimate work.




  Although humanoid, tengus have very distinct, birdlike features, and many would
  say that they resemble crows more than they do humans. They have strong, thick beaks,
  as well as sharp talons at the ends of their arms and legs. Most of a tengu''s body
  is covered in small feathers that range in color from dark brown and midnight blue
  to glossy black, with lighter colors being rare but not unheard of. Like many avian
  creatures, tengus have hollow bones, making them much lighter than other humanoids
  of their size, although few tengus possess the wings necessary to fly naturally.
  A tengu''s speech might be punctuated by quick clucks or throaty cawing, and many
  tengus practice conversation diligently to rid themselves of these involuntary ticks.
  Ruf  ing of the feathers and compulsive, jerky movements of the neck are other trademark
  habits. Tengus reproduce by laying eggs: the average tengu egg is about 11 inches
  in diameter and 16 inches tall and takes 4 months to hatch.




  Tengus are a people in diaspora and are almost always found within larger kingdoms
  and communities of other races. Perhaps because they are more visually distinctive
  than most other humanoid races, tengus tend to be distrusted and persecuted more
  often than, for example, elves or dwarves. As a result, tengus tend to gather in
  close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and people of uncommon ancestry.
  Few true tengu communities exist, and those that do are often exiled to ghettos
  and other forgotten city quarters. From an early age, tengus learn that the world
  is not a friendly place and that they must look out for themselves.
