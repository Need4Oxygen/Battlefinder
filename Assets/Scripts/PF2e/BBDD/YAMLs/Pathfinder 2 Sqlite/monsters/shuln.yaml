description: 'Scourges of the upper Darklands, these enormous, mole-like monstrosities
  slice and burrow through solid stone with massive forearms and adamantine-strong
  claws. Shulns grow to about 20 feet long and have four tiny, nearly imperceptible
  eyes; a long, pale snout; four thick-muscled legs that end in long, serrated claws;
  and a stubby pink tail. As a young shuln matures, its unique metabolism produces
  adamantine that becomes infused throughout its skeletal system. In addition to making
  their claws and fangs nearly unbreakable, this unique physiological trait makes
  shulns unparalleled burrowers and highly sought by monster hunters who hope to harvest
  the precious material from their corpses.




  Shulns have a ravenous appetite and eat nearly anything they can catch, but their
  preferred diet consists almost entirely of large invertebrates, especially cave
  worms. They rely on tiny sensory whiskers that cover their snoutfland allow them
  to detect subtle movements in the air and ground without the use of vision. When
  it detects suitable prey, a shuln bites the target at the first opportunity, injecting
  it with a potent paralytic toxin present in its saliva. So strong is this poison
  that it is capable of subduing even the near-unstoppable purple worm, making the
  shuln a valuable (if dangerous) companion to have for anyone making excursions into
  worm-infested regions of the Darklands. Shulns'' notoriously ill-tempered dispositions
  and their knack for digging into areas of an underground settlement where digging
  ought not occur makes them frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative
  is an unpredictable but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances
  are well worth the trouble.




  Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest that
  these creatures may have originated from that place. The larger shulns still retain
  their elemental qualities, are quite a bit smarter, and have their own suite of
  earth-themed innate primal spellsâ€”but for all that, they still love the taste of
  cave worm.
