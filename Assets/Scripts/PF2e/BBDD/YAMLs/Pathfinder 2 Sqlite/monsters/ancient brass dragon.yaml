description: 'Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play.
  They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids,
  delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness
  or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort
  of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they
  can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information
  networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid
  societyâ€”networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near
  their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons
  use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.




  These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to
  live as they please, provided they don''t harm others. They are emotional creatures
  and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in
  their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants
  that they can care for.




  Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass
  dragon''s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory
  or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent
  guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.




  Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden,
  they often build near humanoid settlements.
