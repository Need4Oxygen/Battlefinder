description: 'The drakauthix is a massive fungus that floats through the heights of
  the largest Darklands caverns, propelled by bladders that spray air and spores.
  A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures
  from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The
  drakauthix''s digestive process is entirely externalâ€”it clings to victims, and its
  spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested
  carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and
  releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately
  scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.




  The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often
  uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the
  hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents.
  When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down,
  hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless
  ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply
  slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace.
  Of course, the drakauthix isn''t above feasting on more active prey as well, and
  might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring
  a network of mysterious caves.




  Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their
  flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean races also
  make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding and pressing
  the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.
