description: 'Kishi are duplicitous and murderous fey who dwell on the edges of Golarion''s
  darkest jungles. At first glance, kishi appear to be attractive humans, usually
  of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face,
  that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable situation,
  their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this form, a kishi''s
  powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim''s bones
  in a matter of moments. Kishi are highly varied in their physical features, and
  their height and weight are as variable as the people whose communities they infiltrate.




  Like most fey, a kishi''s motives are inscrutable, though to its victims, the kishi''s
  goal seems simple—to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a
  victim''s face. Although kishi can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent,
  most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts,
  and their dashing good looks. Kishi are the ultimate sociopaths, deriving pleasure
  from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more
  uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better, for nothing satisfies kishi as
  much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.




  When kishi get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic
  moments to reveal their true, monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their
  victim. Kishi have no desire to share their true nature with the entire village,
  so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who, cut off from air, are
  unable to cry out for help. Kishi consume every part of their victims'' bodies,
  leaving no trace of the crime—even lapping up any spilled blood and cleaning the
  murder scene as much as they are able.
