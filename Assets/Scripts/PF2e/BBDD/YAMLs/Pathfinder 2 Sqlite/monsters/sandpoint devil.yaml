description: 'While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that''s
  graceful and beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and
  body of a powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of
  a humanoid gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal,
  yellowed fangs and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature''s back bears
  a draconic tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.




  The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists gather
  around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children, with little
  left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.
