description: 'With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magnificence of a powerful
  horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps
  the creation of a flesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of
  their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their
  favored plains or hill country.




  Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration
  similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce
  specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and
  tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with
  some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.




  Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins,
  hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred
  meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs'' superior speed helps protect
  them from these predators.




  Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their
  domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally
  hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which
  they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs
  prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.




  Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock,
  such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs
  frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermic
  remains of deer, elk, and bears.




  However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite
  soldiers in combatâ€” the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region
  is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes
  made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more
  difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that
  allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding
  interfering with the movement of their companion''s wings.
