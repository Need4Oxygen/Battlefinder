  effect: The assassin vine causes vegetation within a 20-foot emanation to writhe
    for 1 round, turning this area into difficult terrain. When a creature starts
    its turn in this area, it must attempt a DC 20 Reflex save. On a failure, it takes
    a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on
    a critical failure it is also __immobilized__ for 1 round. A creature can attempt
    to __Escape__ to remove these effects. Assassin vines are immune to Grasping Foliage.

description: 'The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite.
  Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling
  prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls
  the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin
  vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its
  root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat
  changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its
  learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.




  As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area
  for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails
  or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly
  tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can''t be trained in the classical
  sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins
  and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes
  into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious
  than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure
  the bones of the vines'' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting
  in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.




  Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off
  the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these
  vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and
  occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of
  plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant
  iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.
