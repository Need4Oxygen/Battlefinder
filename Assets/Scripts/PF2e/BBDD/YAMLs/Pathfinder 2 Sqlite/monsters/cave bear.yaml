description: 'Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins,
  the cave bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in
  remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in natural
  caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is fiercely territorial. Unlike a
  grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its foe
  is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey''s soft flesh once it has
  been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits by
  remote-dwelling people, while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even
  giantsâ€”stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave bears
  as pets or guardians for their homes.
