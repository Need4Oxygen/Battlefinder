description: 'The monstrous giant anaconda is capable of swallowing whole creatures
  as big as horsesâ€”to say nothing of their riders. Although novice bushwhackers watch
  out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above, giant anacondas
  are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where they feed on prey including
  manatees and capybaras.
