description: 'The "towering" hunchbacked nuglubs are among the largest gremlins, though
  they''re not quite three feet tall. Nuglubs have three glowing blue eyes and black,
  oily hair on their head and back that covers them like a cloak. Nuglubs enjoy killing
  with a glee that other gremlins reserve for sabotage. Indeed, they spend long hours
  preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of sleeping villagers.
  Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy building traps.
  They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims consider familiar,
  such as front doors and the floors around beds. If someone else gets blamed for
  the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better.




  In combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to
  envy on the part of the nuglubs, who find it difficult to fit armor on their twisted
  bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over
  them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend
  upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains.




  Nuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead
  to violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins
  is more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.
