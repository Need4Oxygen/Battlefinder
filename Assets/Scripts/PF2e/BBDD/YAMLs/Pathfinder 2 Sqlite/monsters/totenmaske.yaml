description: 'Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove
  them when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most self-indulgent
  and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these foul undead
  can drain the very flesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves in a perverse
  mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants. Totenmaskes'' specific
  longings varyâ€”one might be obsessed with food or drink, while another might be vain
  and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a mirror, while yet another could
  simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the sensation the totenmaske seeks,
  it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is what helped condemn it to
  unlife in the first place. A totenmaske obsessed with food, for example, might find
  itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain totenmaske obsessed with glamor
  could quickly grow bored of each new look and switch its victims out daily, or even
  hourly.
