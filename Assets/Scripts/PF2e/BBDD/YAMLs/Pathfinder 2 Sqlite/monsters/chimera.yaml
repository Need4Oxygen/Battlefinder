description: 'The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up
  of a monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion,
  a dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it
  sees, but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve
  as a guardian or even a mount.
