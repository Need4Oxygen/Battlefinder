description: 'Wasp nests are made of chewed wood fibers foraged from the surrounding
  flora, which the wasps make into a material similar to paper. A single wasp nest
  can house thousands of individuals that emerge as a massive swarm. Most swarms attack
  only to protect their nest or if otherwise agitated, though druids and other primal
  enchanters can bend these venomous vermin to their willâ€”to deadly effect.
