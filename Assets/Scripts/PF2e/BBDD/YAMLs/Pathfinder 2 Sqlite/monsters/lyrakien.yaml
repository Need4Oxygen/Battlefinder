description: 'Lyrakiens are musical messengers and embodiments of free travel. They
  serve Desna and other deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, but are quite fond
  of the concept of free time and are always on the hunt for opportunities to pause
  in their duties to enjoy music or appreciate a moment of beauty. They love contests,
  stories, and songs, and they often challenge mortals to musical contests or pester
  them to share grand tales of their exploits. Lyrakiens rely on their agility to
  avoid conflicts, but they do their best to defend places of great natural beauty,
  especially against lawful or evil foes they can damage with their starlight. Lyrakiens
  have an innate wanderlust and rarely stay in the same place for very long. Some
  travel alongside adventurers, ofter writing songs about their quests and feats of
  derring-do.




  Though light-hearted creatures, lyrakiens don''t let their whimsical personalities
  get in the way of protecting breathtaking natural locations. Often called "glistenwings"
  by gnomes and halflings, they are frequently mistaken for sprites or similar fey,
  a bit of confusion that many lyrakiens dind amusing and fertile ground for shenanigans
  involving those they deem deserving of a bit of unexpected fun and discord in their
  lives.
