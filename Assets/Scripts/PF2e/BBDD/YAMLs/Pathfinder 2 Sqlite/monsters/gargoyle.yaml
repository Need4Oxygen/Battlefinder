description: "Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their\
  \ resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the\
  \ day and descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that\
  \ of a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great\
  \ deal of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling\
  \ no known creature. A gargoyle's features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles\
  \ who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the\
  \ style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for\
  \ long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.\n\n\n\
  \nGargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes\
  \ called \"wings\" for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively\
  \ stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures\
  \ such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a\
  \ razor's edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and pettyâ€”traits\
  \ that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive.\
  \ Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others\
  \ are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain\
  \ artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings\
  \ as individuals' obsessions and compulsions clash. \n\n## Kapoacinth\n\n Kapoacinths\
  \ dwell not amid cliffs or rooftops, but beneath the sea, using their wings to swim.\
  \ These water-dwelling gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions and shamble\
  \ forth from the sea to attack prey. Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend\
  \ to create more stable wings for longer periods of time. Kapoacinths have the same\
  \ abilities as the gargoyle presented below, but with the following adjustments:\
  \ they have the aquatic trait, they have a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of a fly\
  \ Speed, and their Clawed Feat reaction triggers when they are Swimming instead\
  \ of Flying.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Beast__ (__Arcana__, __Nature__)**: DC\
