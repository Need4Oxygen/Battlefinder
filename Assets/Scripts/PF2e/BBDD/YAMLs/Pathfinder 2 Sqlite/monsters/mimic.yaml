  description: The mimic is coated in an adhesive slime. Any creature that hits the
    mimic, is hit by the mimic, or otherwise touches the mimic must succeed at a DC
    23 Reflex save or become grabbed (Escape DC 23). A weapon that hits the mimic
    is stuck to the mimic and can be removed with a successful DC 23 Athletics check
    (made as a single action). A mimic can have any number of objects or creatures
    stuck to it at a time. The mimic can release a stuck creature or object by using
    a single action, and the adhesive dissolves 1 minute after the mimic dies, releasing
    all stuck objects and creatures.

description: 'Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects
  or a sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the
  form of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious eaters,
  surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form of common
  furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting adventurers happen
  by, then they lash out in ambush.




  Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving, they
  also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown reasons,
  they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike for others
  of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate form for
  an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a dungeon chamber
  for decades. Regardless of how long it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert,
  ready to strike at any moment.
