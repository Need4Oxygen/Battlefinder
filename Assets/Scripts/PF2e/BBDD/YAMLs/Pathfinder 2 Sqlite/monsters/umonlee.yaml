description: 'Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal
  beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes.
  Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown
  of the World named this monster the umonlee.




  Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of
  a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are
  semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they
  are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked
  areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse
  group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of
  Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses
  the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter
  with one of these monstrosities.




  Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to __chuuls__, as the creatures
  exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that
  use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees
  typically only speak __Aklo__, which also gives credence to this theory. This would
  also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of __alghollthu__ manipulation,
  meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs. However, the
  fact that these creatures aren''t evil argues well against such a theory.
