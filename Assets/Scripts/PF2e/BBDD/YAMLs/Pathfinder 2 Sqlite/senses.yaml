    A creature with darkvision or greater darkvision can see perfectly well in
    areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only.
    Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level *darkness* spell, block normal
    darkvision. A creature with greater darkvision, however, can see through even
    these forms of magical darkness.

    Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague
    sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature
    or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually
    do not exude an aroma). If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple
    the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce
    the range if a creature is downwind.

    of bright light, it’s dazzled.
