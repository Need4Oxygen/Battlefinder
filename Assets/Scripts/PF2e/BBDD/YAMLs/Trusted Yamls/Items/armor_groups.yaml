- name: Chain
  descr:
    The armor is so flexible it can bend with a critical hit and absorb some
    of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by either 4 + the value of the
    armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor’s potency
    rune for heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled
    for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.
