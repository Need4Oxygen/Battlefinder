      You understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and

      and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft
      temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical
      items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power
      dramatically, leaving behind those who don’t understand your strange science. You gain the
      Alchemical Crafting feat (page 258), even if you don’t meet that feat’s prerequisites,
      and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. The catalog
      of alchemical items begins on page 543. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as
      long as you have the items’ formulas in your formula book.

    descr:
      You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items
      at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused
      reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either
      advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.
      As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day’s
      preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day’s infused items
      immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can’t be duplicated, preserved, or
      created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion
      and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.

      from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. The catalog of alchemical items begins on page 543. Each
      time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book.
      These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically,
      but it’s also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to
      invent them with the Inventor feat (page 262).
