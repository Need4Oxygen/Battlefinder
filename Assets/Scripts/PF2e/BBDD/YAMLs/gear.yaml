    The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics
    check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking
    persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a 5-foot penalty to its Speed. Spending
    an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding.
    Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other
    creatures moving into the square are safe. Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and

    weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines
    the damage type that's appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.

  descr: You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration
    activity taking 10--30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles
    you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a -15-foot circumstance
    penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to
    succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that
    action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain
    the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures
    with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any.
    Freeing a creature from superior manacles require six successes at DC 42.
