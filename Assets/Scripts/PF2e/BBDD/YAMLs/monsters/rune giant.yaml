description: 'Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema
  to and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and magically
  control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more powerful masters—potent
  wizards known as runelords—and in so doing commanded entire armies of giants on
  behalf of the runelords'' empires. In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune
  giants have persisted as a people of their own, though to the outside world they''re
  little more than fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants.
  Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges,
  but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys,
  or even more remote or magical regions.




  Rune giants'' striking charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which are
  potent manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are towering creatures,
  averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.
