description: 'Bulettes are fearsome predators that roam just beneath the surface of
  desolate wilderness areas. When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of
  their thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap
  out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have
  earned the nickname "landshark."




  A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it
  finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its
  regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements
  off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly
  with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict
  with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory
  and mate for life—a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the
  creature''s penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time.
  The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which
  creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive
  off their young after its first successful hunt.




  The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening
  pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as
  well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting
  accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the
  first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor
  may have been an elf—a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that
  bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately
  for elves who stumble into a bulette''s path, bulettes are no less likely to kill
  them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.
