description: 'The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it
  prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for
  short periods, leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious
  waste that other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter.
  The catoblepas bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats
  everything weaker.




  A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.
