description: 'Unlike its smaller cousins, the giant jellyfish is an active predator
  that chases down its prey through reefs or open water. It can even squeeze its enormous
  bell-shaped body into the tight confines of shipwrecks to drape its mane of tentacles
  across the exposed flesh of its prey.
