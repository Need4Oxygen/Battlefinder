description: 'A ramshackle collection of materials in a human shape, the scarecrow
  construct is indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow until it slowly creaks to
  life. As it animates, its carved pumpkin or sackcloth face bursts into eldritch
  flame, sending fear creeping into the air around it. Each scarecrow is handcrafted
  and unique in its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of
  a combination of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and
  similar materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments. This rudimentary construction
  makes a scarecrow somewhat fragile, prone to snapping limbs in the crush of battle.
  Yet its structure is adaptable, allowing it to reshape another piece of itself into
  a clawed limb or grip a severed portion of itself to swat at its foes.




  When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator''s blood
  into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny sliver
  of the creator''s soul awayâ€”not enough to harm the creator, but more than enough
  to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to follow commands
  as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When a scarecrow is destroyed,
  the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion of the creator''s soul never
  returns.
