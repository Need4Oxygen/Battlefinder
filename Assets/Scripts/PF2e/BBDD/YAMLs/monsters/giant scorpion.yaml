description: 'These massive, terrifying arachnids are typically 8 feet long from head
  to the base of the tail. Giant scorpions are the favored pack animals and war beasts
  of various desert-dwelling monsters, particularly gnolls. They are most commonly
  encountered in the wild, however. There they lair in mountainside caves or burrow
  beneath shallow layers of sand where they lie in wait for prey to wander near. Sleek,
  pallid subterranean scorpions also exist, as do still larger species.
