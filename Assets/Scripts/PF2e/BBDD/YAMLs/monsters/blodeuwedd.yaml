description: 'The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the
  boundaries between the __Material Plane__ and the __First World__ have worn thin,
  or around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural
  world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between __nymphs__ and places
  of great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them
  for something as elegant as a nymph.




  Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians of
  the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from forming as
  powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part of either reality
  yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow cynical and sharp-tongued
  toward any who would seek travel from one realm to the other, regardless of their
  actual goals.
