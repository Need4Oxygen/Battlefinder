description: 'For all their advancement in agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry,
  shoonies subscribe to a remarkably antiquated form of leadership; the role of hierarch
  is normally inherited, passed on to the oldest living child of the village''s previous
  hierarch. In the instance that the village''s hierarch does not produce an heir,
  the village holds a general election. Elected hierarchs hold the term for life and
  are just as highly regarded as hierarchs raised from birth. When the settlement
  comes under attack, it is up to the hierarch to decide when to fight and when to
  flee. In most cases, shoonies prefer to elect individuals with a preference toward
  the latter.
