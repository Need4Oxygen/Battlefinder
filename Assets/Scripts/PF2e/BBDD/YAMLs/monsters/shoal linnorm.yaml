description: 'Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither along lonely
  coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek out large settlements, these linnorms
  nonetheless beleaguer fishers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may
  even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the town''s defenses and
  plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt large prey, both underwater and on land.
  Their preferred quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bearsâ€”meals rich in fat,
  which the linnorms metabolize into the fiery steam that courses through their veins.
