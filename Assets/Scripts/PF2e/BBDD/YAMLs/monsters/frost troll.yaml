description: Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and
  hoarfrost teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls
  often hunt in packs of threeâ€”one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining
  two pause to assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish
  the taste of human flesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in
  close proximity to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a
  typical frost troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds.
  Their sickly, cracked flesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn
  themselves with trophies of bone and hide flayed from their kills.
