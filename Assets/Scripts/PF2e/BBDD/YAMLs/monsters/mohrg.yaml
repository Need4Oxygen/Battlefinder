description: "The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a\
  \ lifetime of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty\
  \ soldiers, or sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution\
  \ stanch their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they\
  \ may rise after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work.\n\n\n\nDrawn to\
  \ others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally in partnership\
  \ with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They seek out weak\
  \ prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt locations they\
  \ favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even skulk about\
  \ in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their nature.\
  \ The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no longer fear\
  \ being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to turn living\
  \ towns into mass graves.\n\n\n\nSince those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter\
  \ as mohrg spawn, the murders of a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when\
  \ they take extra care to prey only on a society's dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain\
  \ under a mohrg's control, a canny mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding\
  \ to keep its presence secret until a point where it feels confident unleashing\
  \ its undead army upon a doomed settlement. Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality\
  \ for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking out trinkets that remind them of\
  \ favorite murders. When not out hunting, mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing\
  \ shrines. Often, these trinkets are valuable objects, and might even provide important\
  \ clues to ongoing mysteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Mohrg Spawn\n\n When a creature returns\
  \ after death as a mohrg spawn, its flesh decays away save for its entrails, and\
  \ it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead trait and becomes\
  \ chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature.\
  \ It gains __darkvision__, __negative healing__, and the mohrg's immunities and\
  \ resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack\
  \ that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an __agile__\
  \ attack that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the\
  \ DC for the __mohrg spawn's level__. Mohrg spawn cannot create mohrg spawn of their\
  \ own.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Undead__ (__Religion__)**: DC 24"
