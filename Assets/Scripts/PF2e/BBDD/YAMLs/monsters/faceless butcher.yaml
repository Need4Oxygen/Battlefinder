description: 'The deformed flesh on this humanoid horror''s head bears grim holes
  where their eyes, nose, mouth, and ears should be, and little else. Stories of faceless
  butchers always center on the monstrous murderer''s preferred weapon: a wicked and
  bloodstained meat cleaver, which the butcher uses to carve flesh from skull to add
  to their collection of stolen faces. Once they''ve taken a victim''s face, the faceless
  butcher can wear it, transform into an exact replica of the deceased, and begin
  stalking their next victim.
