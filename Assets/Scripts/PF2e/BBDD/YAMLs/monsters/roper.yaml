description: 'To all but the most sharp-eyed underground explorers, a roper appears
  to be nothing more than a large stalactite, stalagmite, or pillar of ice. Cunning
  and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.




  Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside
  other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes
  hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and
  the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper
  can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking
  spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper''s appetite by entertaining it with stories
  or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing
  prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers
  who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by
  roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don''t eventually escape, the ropers''
  appetites win out over their intellectual curiosityâ€”especially in cases where the
  pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers'' wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet
  tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.

    Each additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1

    hours. The roper can move while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it

    roper can release an grabbed creature as a free action. A creature can sever a
    strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage.
    This doesn't deal any damage to the roper itself, though it can no longer attack
    with a severed strand.
