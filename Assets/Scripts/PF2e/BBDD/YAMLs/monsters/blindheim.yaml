description: 'Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby
  humanoids with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft
  glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally
  covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use
  their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents,
  or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young.
  When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their
  eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small
  packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on
  the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving
  deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches
  them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.




  Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground
  lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat,
  a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling.
  Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they
  emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents
  cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.




  It''s not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures
  useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. __Duergars__ use them
  as "raid frogs," placing heavy hoods over blindheims'' heads and revealing them
  suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along
  with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. __Drow__
  use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat
  the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls.
  Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims
  rarely last long in captivity.
