description: 'Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always find
  their way into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every
  lake of respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of fishers claiming
  to have spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool
  and gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of __sea serpents__
  and __linnorms__, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.




  Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand
  the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain
  hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those
  they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur
  when they can''t help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone (or
  something) particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water''s surface.




  These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries,
  with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing
  for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water
  orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing
  to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors
  might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution
  residents against venturing out alone near the water.




  While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others
  look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses,
  or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of __elasmosauruses__.
