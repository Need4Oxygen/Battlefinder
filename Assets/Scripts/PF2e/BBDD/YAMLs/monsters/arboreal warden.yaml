description: 'Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant
  folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely
  stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust
  makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants,
  they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report
  any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens
  congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate
  the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before returning to
  report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand to other creatures''
  motivesâ€”like most forces of the natural world, they are ambivalent about mortal
  affairs that do not involve their forest.
