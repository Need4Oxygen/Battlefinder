description: 'Cu siths are hound-like doorkeepers of remote portals to other planes,
  particularly portals to the untamed realm of the fey, the First World. They are
  highly territorial and roam the highland moors they call home, constantly on the
  hunt for any creatures that might intrude on their territory. Those that bargain
  for safe passage to or from a portal find cu siths to be vigilant escorts that keep
  travelers safe from extraplanar threats but also ensure their charges don''t veer
  from the most direct path to their destination. Cu siths are highly proficient hunters,
  and to mortals they offer a single warning in the form of their terrifying bark.
  Creatures that refuse to flee upon hearing a cu sith''s warning bark risk a quick
  and brutal death.




  Cu siths cut imposing figures; they are as large as bulls and covered in intertwining
  roots, plant matter, and shaggy green and white fur that terminates in a long, plaited
  tail. Their eyes glow with a fiery green light.
