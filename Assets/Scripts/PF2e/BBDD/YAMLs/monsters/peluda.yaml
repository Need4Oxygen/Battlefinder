description: 'Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely
  forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch
  of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential
  rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed footprints
  on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses on their quills
  as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt, roasting prey
  with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and killing for
  cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.




  Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves, especially
  humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or breaking.
  In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more impressive
  creaturesâ€”especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try anything to become
  stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, which old folk tales
  claim will strengthen their quills and fire breath.
