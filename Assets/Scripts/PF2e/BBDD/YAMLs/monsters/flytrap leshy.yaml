    Verdant Burst (healing) When a flytrap leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes
    from its body, restoring 3d6 Hit Points to each __plant__ creature in a 30-foot
    emanation. This area immediately fills with flytraps, becoming difficult terrain.
    If the terrain is not a viable environment for these flytraps, they wither after
    24 hours.'
  effect: You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against
    the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was
    a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward
    your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to
    this Strike.

description: 'While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, flytrap leshys get along
  well with other leshys. Nonetheless, they''re among the most aggressive leshys,
  often guarding the most vulnerable places in the natural world with their flytrap
  mouths and hands.




  When a large threat emerges, pairs of flytrap leshys band together to create amalgams
  capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal defense suffuses
  flytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between multiple individuals
  that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight humanoidsâ€”to a flytrap leshy,
  though, there''s nothing strange about sharing your innermost secrets with people
  you literally merged together with to defend your home from an enemy.

  description: A flytrap leshy can combine itself with an adjacent and willing flytrap
    leshy that is not currently affected by Amalgam. The leshy using Amalgam physically
    merges with the target, restoring 3d8 Hit Points to the target. The leshy can
    Sustain a Spell to continue Amalgam, but once they stop, the target leshy takes
    3d8 damage. If the target leshy dies, Amalgam ends at once and the original leshy

    a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, its AC increases to 21, and
