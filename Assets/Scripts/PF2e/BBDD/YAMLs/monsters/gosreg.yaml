description: 'Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves
  into humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They
  act as spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting
  plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.




  In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy
  legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies,
  and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately compromised
  and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their brain-like
  heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of the Black
  agent: the dreaded __intellect devourer__.
