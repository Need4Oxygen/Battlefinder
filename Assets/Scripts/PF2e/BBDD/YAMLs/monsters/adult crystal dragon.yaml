description: 'Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with
  brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source
  of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily
  angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures
  when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone
  to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable,
  crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions
  or distractions.




  Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate
  environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean
  that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of
  their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there
  are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their
  own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted
  mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted
  or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.




  Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or
  their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly.
  While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any
  other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved
  pets, depending upon the creature''s capacity for conversation (and for providing
  the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).
