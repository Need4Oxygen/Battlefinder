description: 'Ankous are shadowy killers who serve powerful fey creatures, or even
  the Eldest— the demigods of the First World. Amid the courts of the Eldest or of
  powerful fey rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call
  to action—implied threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall.
  Ankous never speak aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do
  so in a telepathic whisper directly into a victim''s mind. While an ankou''s body
  is made of strange, fleshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings
  are made of razor-sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other
  fey. A typical ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less
  than 80 pounds.




  While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are left to
  their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In some
  cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have been
  released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge their
  own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!

  effect: For each action spent to use this ability, the ankou creates one shadowy
    duplicate of themself anywhere within 60 feet of themself. Shadow doubles have
    the same statistics as an ankou, but they have the __summoned__ trait, have 84
    Hit Points, can't use Shadow Doubles or innate spells, and have an attack bonus
    of +25 for their Strikes. A shadow double that attempts a saving throw against
    a __light__ effect can't get a result better than failure. Each double remains
    for 1 round, until it's reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until it moves further than
    120 feet from the ankou, whichever comes first. Each round thereafter, the ankou
    can spend a single action that has the __concentrate__ trait to extend the duration
    of surviving duplicates by 1 round, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. The ankou
    can see through the eyes of all of the shadow doubles at once. A character who
    __Seeks__ can identify an ankou as real or a shadow double with a successful DC
    39 Perception check.
