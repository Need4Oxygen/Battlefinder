description: 'Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood
  of roiling lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder.
  They pay homage to __Ymeri__, the evil elemental demigod of fire, and they bully
  other fiery creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans
  burn forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of
  water.
