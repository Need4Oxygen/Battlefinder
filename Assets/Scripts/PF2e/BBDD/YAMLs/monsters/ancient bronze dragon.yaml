description: "Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the\
  \ most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally\
  \ scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore\
  \ than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists,\
  \ guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons\
  \ are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade\
  \ for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their\
  \ protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.\n\n\n\nBronze\
  \ dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon\
  \ to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover\
  \ neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. \n\n\n\
  \nBronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.\
  \ While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles\
  \ a vast libraryâ€”with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course.\
  \ In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures\
  \ associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment\
  \ inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Dragon__\
