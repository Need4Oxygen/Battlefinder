description: 'A bogey typically hunts a single creature at a time, usually a small
  child or elderly person, methodically stalking and tormenting their prey. Often
  hiding under a bed, amid a dark attic space, or in a closet left slightly ajar,
  the bogey delights in the slow, methodical cultivation of fear in its victims.

    **Requirements** The bogey has killed a creature within the last round and is
    adjacent to the creature; **Effect** The bogey consumes the creature''s soul.
    The soul is utterly destroyedâ€”nothing short of wish or a similar effect can restore
    it to life, and only after the bogey has been slain. The bogey regains Hit Points
    equal to double the level of the consumed creature. After devouring three souls
    within a year, the bogey transforms into a bugaboo.'
