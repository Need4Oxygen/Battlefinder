description: 'The stegosaurus is easily recognized by its twin rows of diamond-shaped
  dorsal plates that run down its spine, and thick tail adorned with four large spikes.
  This strange configuration protects this herbivore from predators, as the stegosaurus
  can hunker down to interpose its dorsal plates between an attacker and its thick
  body. A stegosaurus defends itself by swinging its spiked tail at larger foes and
  trampling smaller opponents underfoot.




  The stegosaurus often inhabits grasslands, where nutritious vegetation is plentiful
  and only its dorsal plates rise above waving fields of tall grass. The stegosaurus
  is among the most curious of dinosaurs, and hunters often find it easy to bait them
  with shiny trinkets or strange noises. A stegosaurus is about 30 feet long, 16 feet
  high at the top of its highest dorsal plate, and weighs between 2 and 3 tons.




  The stegosaurus is generally more even-tempered and even gentle, despite its size,
  than the ankylosaurus. This combination makes it even more popular as a trained
  pet or guard, but even then one should take care to not annoy the dinosaurâ€”an angry
  or annoyed stegosaurus can lash out with its tail with little warning. Often, it''s
  wiser to train smaller variants, such as the kentrosaurus. Regardless, their dorsal
  plates make this dinosaur a poor choice as a mount.
