description: 'Dezullons are dangerous carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested
  regions with thick canopies. They hunt for meat along the forest''s understory when
  not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough to notice
  that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use such objects
  to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon''s ambulations are slow simply because
  the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many an adventurer has been
  crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In addition, these dangerous
  plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even more difficult to escape from.




  A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive digestive
  juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the enzymes
  in a dezullon''s digestive tract, once expelled, inflict a victim with powerful
  hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought
  after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and criminals
  who deal in poisons.




  Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of incredible size,
  those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that proliferate along lengths of creeping
  ivy like suckers on a squid''s tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red,
  razor-sharp leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like a leech''s
  teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous, since the leaves can all but
  eviscerate creatures that become ensconced inside their pitchers.
