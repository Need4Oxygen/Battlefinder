description: 'Foul occult magic, rare alchemical reagents, and copious amounts of
  spilled blood are the keys to creating a vitalia—also known as a heart horror— though
  thankfully the exact means of their creation has been long forgotten.




  Now, most vitalias now come into being by sheer accident. This unusual life-form
  cannot live without regular contact with blood, much like how fish cannot live long
  outside of water. Because of this, vitalias are rarely found outside the lairs of
  mad alchemists or wizards, living in pools of the life-giving substance. Physically,
  a vitalia somewhat resembles a blood-red __giant jellyfish__, though it also bears
  some semblance to a giant human heart.
