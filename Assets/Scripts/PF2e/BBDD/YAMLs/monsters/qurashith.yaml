  description: 'Any creature that Strikes the qurashith with a melee weapon must attempt
    a DC 37 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is disarmed of its weapon, which

    A creature must succeed at a DC 31 Athletics check to retrieve a stuck weapon.
    On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 acid damage and the weapon remains stuck,

    stuck to the qurashith and can use an __Escape__ action to try to free itself

description: 'Qurashith—or "gluttonwings" in the Common tongue—are fearsome, bat-like
  predators that haunt the upper reaches of Gluttondark''s cavern-worlds. These monstrosities
  are no mere beasts. A qurashith does not simply devour its victims; once it kills
  its prey, it physically subsumes the creature into its own body, metabolizing the
  prey''s spiritual essence. Close inspection of a qurashith reveals that its body
  is an amalgamation of the fiend and its extraplanar and mortal victims, bound together
  by webs of demonic scar tissue and sticky acidic pus. While the individual personalities
  of a qurashith''s victims gradually metabolize and diffuse into its very substance
  over time, a particularly charismatic or magically powerful victim might exert some
  influence over the qurashith''s mind for a short time.
