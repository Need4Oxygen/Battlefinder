description: 'Nearly all shoonies in a given settlement are farmers, fishers, or foragers.
  Shoonies are not expected to fight to protect their settlements; most agree it is
  better to live in cowardice than to die with that foolish, intangible principle
  taller races call "honor." Many shoonies hone their skill with tools rather than
  arms in the knowledge that whatever is lost to violence can be rebuilt. When cornered,
  a shoony may put up a fight with whatever they have on hand; the average shoony
  can wield a simple shovel or pick in melee as well as most humans can wield a sword.

  raw_description: '**Dig Quickly** [Two Actions]  (__manipulate__) **Requirements**
    You are standing on dirt, sand, snow, or similar particulate material. **Effect**
    Your hands work as effectively as shovels when you need to dig a quick hole. You
    dig a shallow pit in the square you currently occupy, turning the square into
    difficult terrain (including for you). In addition, you also kick up a cloud of
    grit in a direction of your choice. The cloud extinguishes small, unattended,
    non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within
    the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking __persistent fire damage__ can
    immediately attempt an additional flat DC 15 check to end the persistent damage.'
