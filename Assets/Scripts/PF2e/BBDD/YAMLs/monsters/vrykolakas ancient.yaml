  effect: 'Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn''t destroyed when it reaches
    0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet,
    which must attempt a Will save (DC 33). On a failure, the animal is possessed.
    This has the effects of the __possession__ spell, but it lasts a number of days
    equal to the vrykolakas''s level. This possession can''t be counteracted with
    magic (though __remove curse__ works against it normally).


    If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different
    animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save
    or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and
    is destroyed.


    A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound)
