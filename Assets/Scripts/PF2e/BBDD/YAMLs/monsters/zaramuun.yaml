description: 'Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands.
  They disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures.
  The most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they find, but others simply
  rob their victims of all metal and stone possessions before fleeing. Although zaramuuns
  insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this
  is simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material
  components to conjure fiends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth
  after worshipping fiends who promised to give them power over other elementals.
  This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe
  that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.
