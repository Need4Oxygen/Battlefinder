description: 'The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place

  effect: The bone prophet animates corpses of snakes, serpentfolk, or similar serpentine
    creatures within a 30-foot emanation. Any flesh on the bodies sloughs off, and
    they rise as skeletons. The bone prophet can raise one Large creature as a __skeletal
    giant__ or up to three Medium creatures as __skeletal champions__; the equipment
    and attacks might be different depending on the corpses' possessionsThese skeletons
    have the __minion__ trait and are under the bone prophet's control; the bone prophet
    can give all these minions the same command with a single action that has the
    __concentrate__ trait. Any skeletal minions that still remain after 10 minutes
    crumble to dust.
