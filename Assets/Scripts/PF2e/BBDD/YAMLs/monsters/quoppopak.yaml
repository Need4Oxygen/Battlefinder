description: 'Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses,
  and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of
  an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a
  ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey''s mouth and is capable of intaking fluids
  at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer
  to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting
  their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then
  spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like
  tentacles. Though the ventral tube can''t expel fluids, it still poses a substantial
  threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the
  creatures'' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon
  through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for
  quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater,
  and the monsters'' water reserves quickly deplete.
