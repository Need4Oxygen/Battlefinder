description: 'Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting
  any one area''s resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy
  a constant wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their
  ancestors'' spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when they
  are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and
  strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.




  Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They occasionally
  raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than malicious,
  with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people. Nevertheless,
  the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating event to any
  town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants by creating a
  yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are scheduled to come close.




  Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in everything
  they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of those legacies, and
  little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly than insulting their ancestors.
  Merely mentioning the false rumors that ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible
  for the creation of the first rune giants is a surefire way to earn a taiga giant''s
  unending wrath.




  A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.
