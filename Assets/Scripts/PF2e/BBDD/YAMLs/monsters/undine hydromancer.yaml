description: 'Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the briny
  deep flows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and lithe, but they
  are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how much louder and clearer
  sound rings above the waves.




  Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming communities
  along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter case, they prefer to
  settle in ship-towns that sometimes number dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes.
  The undines who fill these communities are similarly diverse, bringing aspects of
  multiple cultures together to form one whole. Ship-towns are permanent, but fluid—they
  grow, recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add their ships to or remove
  them from the flotilla. An undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its
  residents coming ashore only on rare occasions to collect wood for cookfires or
  to repair their homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence of these communities
  reflects the undine virtues of adaptability and freedom, while also maintaining
  the prime importance of the community.




  Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these floating settlements, if only for
  their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.

    Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of __genies__,
    causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though
    the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments,
    geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any
    alignment.


    ##  Geniekin on Golarion


    While most geniekin planar scions live on their genie parent''s ancestral plane,
    rare fonts of elemental power or genie activity sometimes give rise to geniekin
    on Golarion. By far, geniekin are most commonly found in Katapesh, as genies are
    more prevalent there than other regions due to the influence of genie binders.


    ##  Geniekin Parentage


    Planar scions from the elemental planes are known as geniekin because they are
    overwhelmingly born from couplings between mortals and genies: __ifrits__ are
    born of __efreeti__, __oreads__ of __shaitans__, __sulis__ of __jann__, __sylphs__
    of __djinn__, and __undines__ of __marids__. Despite this distinguished ancestry,
    geniekin do not display most of their parents'' exceptional talents, such as their
    ability to grant wishes.'
