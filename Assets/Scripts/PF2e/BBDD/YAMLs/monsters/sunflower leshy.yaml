description: 'Sunflower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind.
  Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a serrated, leafy, beard-like
  ruff. When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight,
  and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows
  correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy
  art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human
  artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing
  upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict
  a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites.




  The more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with
  nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys
  are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove
  their good intentions, though they remain cautious. They''re often accompanied by
  other, more powerful leshys.
