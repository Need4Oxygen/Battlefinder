description: 'Unlike many other types of werecreature, a werebear does not become
  malevolent during its involuntary transformations, but is instead filled with righteous
  conviction. This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though, as a transformed
  werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has little control over
  its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even living together
  as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as long as they live solitary
  lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in wilderness regions without
  the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full and the curse takes hold, they
  will rage against an innocent bystander or loved one. As long as there is nothing
  around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically a forest), a werebear
  in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep away the night.
