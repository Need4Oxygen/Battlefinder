description: 'Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons.
  No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead,
  these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes.
  Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible
  for creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off
  of an even greater being: a mysterious fifth Horseman.




  Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying enough
  to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing eyes
  above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns, olethrodaemons
  resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.
