  description: The crag linnorm breathes out a stream of magma in a 120-foot line
    that deals 12d6 fire damage to creatures within the area (DC 34 basic Reflex save).
    Any creature that fails its save also takes 4d6 persistent fire damage. The crag
    linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds. The magma remains until
    the start of the linnorm's next turn. If the linnorm was on the ground, the magma
    remains as a burning line on the ground directly under the line of the Breath
    Weapon, and if the linnorm was airborne, the magma rains downward in a sheet 60
    feet high. Any creature that moves across or through the magma takes 6d6 fire
    damage (DC 34 basic Reflex save). At the start of the linnorm's next turn, the
    magma cools to a thin layer of brittle stone on the ground, or the magma rain
    finishes falling and turns to harmless pebbles. The cooled magma quickly degrades
    to powder and sand over the course of several hours.
