description: 'Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous
  hunters equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or
  their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that allow them
  to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in flight and on foot. Jungle
  drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run tactics, picking off the weakest
  members of a group and dragging their victims off to finish their meals as they
  please.
