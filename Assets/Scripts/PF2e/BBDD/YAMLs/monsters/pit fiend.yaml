description: "When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire,\
  \ it is likely that one of Hell's most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit\
  \ fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends\
  \ often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal\
  \ worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated\
  \ ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls\
  \ that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed\
  \ through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell's formidable\
  \ legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies,\
  \ drawing upon these lesser devils' depravity during powerful magical ceremonies\
  \ to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the\
  \ pit fiend's enemies.\n\n\n\nPit fiends themselves are crafted deep within the\
  \ nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils\
  \ and infernal dukes. Those pit fiends that don't leave Nessus to command infernal\
  \ legions in the upper layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell's elite, gathering\
  \ cabals and sects that shape Hell's political landscape through subterfuge and\
  \ manipulation. But many pit fiends see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire,\
  \ the all-encompassing wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed\
  \ by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build\
  \ vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in flame to lord over.\n\n\n\nPit fiends tower\
  \ over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds,\
  \ and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet. \n\n## Infernal Dukes\n\n Elite\
  \ members of Hell's political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the dukes\
  \ of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and conniving devils.\
  \ While not all infernal dukes are pit fiends, a pit fiend's natural disposition\
  \ toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate for this position.\
  \ To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit fiend to be between 21st and 25th level.\
  \ Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and powerful spellcasting\
  \ abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-running campaigns.\n\
