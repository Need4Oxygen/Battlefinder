description: "Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways\
  \ and are equally at home on land and in the water. A hezrou's presence has an obvious\
  \ effect on nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot and infusing\
  \ water with a foul odor and brackish tasteâ€”signs much easier to spot on the Material\
  \ Plane than in the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations\
  \ and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures\
  \ sometimes rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer\
  \ simple pleasures, and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit\
  \ of comfortable places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty\
  \ to deface. They do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away\
  \ those who seek to worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who\
  \ abused and polluted their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction\
  \ of toxins to the region or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a\
  \ society. \n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fiend__ (__Religion__)**: DC 28"
