description: 'Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as
  well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand
  their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes
  advantage of a green dragon''s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any
  misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green
  dragons do not suffer foolsâ€”and the threshold for what they consider foolish is
  very low.




  Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and
  dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the
  most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the
  heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make
  their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.




  Green dragons'' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes.
  They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated.
  This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer
  to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular
  field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen
  name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons
  seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely
  to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.




  Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and
  scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons.
  Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived
  an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts
  or lost lore from ancient cultures.
