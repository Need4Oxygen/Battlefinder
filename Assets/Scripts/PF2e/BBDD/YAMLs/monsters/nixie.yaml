description: 'These aquatic fey often guard ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs, protecting
  their bucolic homes from the advances of predators and careless humanoids alike.
  Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids,
  hoping trespassers won''t give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted
  by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive
  fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon.
  On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a
  positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing
  openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid.
  Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them
  first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing
  story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more
  significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating
  the source of pollution near their home.




  Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions
  that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed.
  In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals
  and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully.
  While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area,
  others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies
  recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply
  too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic
  to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only
  those who manage to befriend a nixie are given invitations to return to swim or
  dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.




  Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like
  whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and long
  hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater
  societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures'' folklore, there
  are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.
