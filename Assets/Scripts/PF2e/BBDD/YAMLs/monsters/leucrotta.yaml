description: 'The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species
  of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding
  vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can first torment
  and then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds,
  and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta''s oversized jaws are lined with rows
  of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh,
  bone, and even steel with ease.

    last action was Sound Mimicry; **Effect** The leucrotta utters a plaintive cry
    to draw its prey closer. Each creature within the emanation that was deceived
    by Sound Mimicry must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become **fascinated** and
    compelled to move toward the sound of the leucrotta''s voice on their turn. Fascinated
    creatures are also **flat-footed**. If the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated condition
    ends only for the creature that is attacked. If the leucrotta speaks a creature''s
    name while using its Luring Cry, that creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty
    to their saving throw to resist the ability. On a successful save, a creature
    is temporarily immune to Luring Cry for 24 hours.'
