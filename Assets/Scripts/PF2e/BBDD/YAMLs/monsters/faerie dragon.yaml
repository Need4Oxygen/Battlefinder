description: 'Although they are much smaller than their larger dragon cousins, faerie
  dragons have the many of the same physiological attributes, including long necks,
  toothy maws, sinuous tails, and sharp claws. They flit about on iridescent butterfly
  wings, the coloring of which changes based on where they live, giving them a natural
  camouflage. Unlike their larger kin, an adult faerie dragon remains the same size
  throughout its lifespan. The only visual clue to the age of a faerie dragon is the
  sheen on its scales, a glimmer that becomes more lustrous the older it gets.




  Faerie dragons usually exhibit pleasant and good-natured temperaments, though they
  have a mischievous streak that leads them to play tricks on those around them. In
  search of an amusement, they prefer harmless annoyances to wounding malice. While
  often spontaneous, they may also spend months if not years planning the perfect
  prank. Especially responsive targets endear themselves to faerie dragons and may
  create a lifelong bond. A faerie dragon''s reputation as a trickster leads many
  to associate them with fey, with whom the tiny dragons have cordial relationships.




  Peaceful by nature, faerie dragons do not enjoy confrontation. If faced with hostility,
  they prefer to remain at a distance and breathe euphoric gas at their foes, diffusing
  the skirmish by creating an atmosphere of bliss. If conflict escalates, they target
  their opponents with spells, using their renowned trickery to escape. If their companions
  are in danger, however, their desire to remain out of combat changes. Faerie dragons
  protect their friends by any means available, including physical combat.




  Sometimes as faerie dragons grow older, their connection to the First World grows
  stronger. In addition to growing more lustrous and vibrant in appearance, these
  faerie dragons gain an increasing amount of magical primal power. Such faerie dragons
  increase in strength as appropriateâ€”a faerie dragon of 20th level or even higher
  is possible, but it is exceptionally unusual to encounter a faerie dragon of 9th
  level or higher beyond the most remote regions of the First World. When creating
  a more powerful faerie dragon, change its tradition to primal and grant it a number
  of primal spells known appropriate for a druid of its level. Faerie dragons don''t
  grow much larger, regardless of how powerful they become. Those who would seek to
  torment or vex a faerie dragon would do well to consider this, as it''s often difficult
  to tell how powerful one of these tiny dragons truly is at a simple glance!
