  description: Whenever the carnivorous crystal takes a critical hit from an attack
    that deals bludgeoning or sonic damage, or it critically fails its saving throw
    against an effect that deals bludgeoning or sonic damage, it might split. If the
    carnivorous crystal has at least 15 HP remaining after taking the damage, it splits
    into two identical crystals, each with half the original's Hit Points. When the
    carnivorous crystal splits, one crystal remains in the same space and the other
    appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, the
    crystal automatically pushes creatures out of the way to fill a space.
