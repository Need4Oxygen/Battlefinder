description: 'The majority of mummies were created by cruel and selfish masters to
  serve as guardians to protect their tombs from intruders. The traditional method
  of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well
  before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically
  starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents,
  and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains
  immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails
  are extracted before it''s shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a
  necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant
  future. While it''s certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian
  from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their
  guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead—the
  pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.




  Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical
  shells of flesh and bone—they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds,
  with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead
  anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over
  the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus
  when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at
  nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.
