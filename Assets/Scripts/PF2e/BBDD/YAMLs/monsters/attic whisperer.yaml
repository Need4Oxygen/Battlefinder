description: 'Beware the haunting sobs of the attic whisperer, for they carry the
  pained wrath of an abandoned child who perished due to the neglect or absence of
  their caretakers. Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to
  the material world in a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhoodâ€”wooden
  blocks, scraps of blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles.
  To give themselves the semblance of a head, they top their patchwork bodies with
  a small animal''s skull.




  Attic whisperers most frequently lurk in old infirmaries, orphanages, and other
  such institutions where children were forgotten, and they lay dormant for decades
  in hopes that they might one day find a playmate to ease their eternal loneliness.
  When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches
  by calling out to them using the voice of a small child. Though attic whisperers
  intend only to play with those they encounter, they drain the breath and voice from
  living creatures as their dark impulses take over.
