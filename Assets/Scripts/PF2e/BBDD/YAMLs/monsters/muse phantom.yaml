description: 'For performers who die before their time and whose love of the theater
  is stronger than death''s grasp, the show does indeed go on. Such actors rise from
  the grave to become muse phantoms—undead spirits that haunt opera houses or auditoriums
  and possess the bodies of living actors to continue their art.




  A host is often utterly unaware of being possessed by a muse phantom. Like egotistical
  parasites, muse phantoms assume command of their unwitting thespian shells only
  during big shows with packed audiences, and even then the host might chalk up their
  sudden lack of control to the transcendence of performance, not the nefarious influence
  of some paranormal entity. In time, a performer''s mind can become utterly warped
  by the spirit''s domination, twisting artistic temperament and vanity into evil
  selfishness and tireless obsession.

    This has the same effect as the possession spell (DC 20), except the duration
    is 1d4 hours, and since the phantom muse doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected
    by that restriction of the spell. If the target is at least trained in __Performance__,
    the DC of this ability is 24.
