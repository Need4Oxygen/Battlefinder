description: 'Gimmerlings are small, shapeshifting fey who stage ambushes to sate
  their endless hunger and childish greed. These cruelly curious fey obsess over finding
  and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is se
  eing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When on the Material Plane, they
  are frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of town where
  they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgottenâ€”and have plenty of victims to
  choose from.




  A typical gimmerling disguises itself as an endangered child, doing so in hopes
  of drawing creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts itself in apparent
  danger using a trap, construct, or bribed ally, or even a coerced monster like a
  redcap.




  Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques in exchange
  for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they have at
  times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge. Some disciplined gimmerlings work
  as honored artisans, elite guards, or spies for the demigods known as the Eldest
  who dwell in the depths of the First World.
