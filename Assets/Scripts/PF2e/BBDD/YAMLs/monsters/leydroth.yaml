description: 'In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts
  with both supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent
  weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the first
  leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true,
  and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators.




  Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing
  from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.
