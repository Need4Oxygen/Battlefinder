  description: 40 feet. A creature entering the aura must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude
    save or be sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for the same duration on a critical failure).
    On a success, the creature is temporarily immune to the sickened and slowed effects
    of this stench for 1 hour. Regardless of the save, while within the aura, creatures
    take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against diseases. An otyugh's stench is
    due to the offal and refuse that it wallows in, so cleaning the creature thoroughly
    (with __create water__ and sufficient scrubbing, for example) deactivates the
    aura, while a sufficiently plugged nose allows an individual to avoid exposure
    to the stench.

description: 'Lords of sewers, ditches, and landfllls, otyughs are   lthy monstrosities
  that stomp about on three massive legs in search of tasty garbage and refuse. Using
  two barbed tentacles to grasp and tear, guided by a third with a proliferation of
  eyes at the end, the otyugh has perfectly adapted to life in its cramped, disgusting
  environment, where it uses its appendages to see into tight spaces and grasp hidden
  prey.




  Most assume that otyughs originally evolved in swamps and moved into sewers as civilization
  encroached on their natural habitats. True or not, they are now one of the larger
  predators in those dank environs. Otyughs are territorial, but they have been known
  to form loose collectives, even giving each other important-sounding titles like
  "king of offal" and "duchess of slime" to indicate their rank and station in their
  sludgy underworld beneath the streets.




  Those who run across an otyugh might be surprised to hear it speak, shouting at
  intruders to leave its putrid home or demanding tribute in the form of trash or
  other prizes of dubious nature.
