description: 'Large and seemingly ponderous, a monitor lizard is a deceptively swift
  and ruthless predator. It ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and biting
  the target with its powerful jaws. A giant monitor lizard''s saliva is venomous,
  allowing it to bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away in its jaws.
  Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet long, including their long tails, and they
  weigh about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally dark brown with patches of yellow
  or green. When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs a deep burrow to hide in. The
  burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the lizard can ambush
  larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor lizard can consume
  nearly its own body weight in a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow
  it to swallow surprisingly large prey.
