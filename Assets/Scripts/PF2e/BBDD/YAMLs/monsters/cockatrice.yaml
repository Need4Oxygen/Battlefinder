description: 'Ugly and aggressive, the dread cockatrice stalks garbage pits and hillside
  dumps in search of prey that it can turn to stone with its petrifying beak and subsequently
  consume piece by broken piece. Cockatrices resemble gaunt and sickly roosters with
  bat wings and serpentine tails, and they rarely grow more than 2 feet tall and twice
  as long. Their absentminded clucking gives smart prey ample warning of their presence,
  and when angered cockatrices let out a shrill crow like that of a rooster. Their
  peck releases a magical toxin that causes flesh to quickly calcify, and any creature
  pecked repeatedly by an irritable cockatrice eventually transforms into a stone
  statue of itself.




  The first cockatrice is rumored to have hatched from a rooster''s egg incubated
  on a dung hill by a toad. Whether or not the rumor is true, the cockatrice''s monstrous
  appearance certainly doesn''t contradict its strange and filthy origin story, and
  these creatures are more than capable of propagating on their own. Cockatrices are
  remarkably fecund and gather in flocks of up to a dozen members. Each flock contains
  only a few females. The males—which differ in appearance from the females by having
  warty wattles and gnarled combs— often fight with each other, with lower-ranking
  males eventually driven away to find their own lairs or compete among other flocks.
  Most creatures who run afoul of a solitary cockatrice do so with one of these surly
  outcasts.




  Cockatrice lairs are often littered with fragments of statuary from past victims—although
  these are as likely to be remnants of frogs, lizards, and insects as people. Curiously,
  weasels and ferrets, who infiltrate cockatrice lairs to steal their eggs, are immune
  to the creatures'' petrifying bites. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified
  of and enraged by conventional roosters, and they are equally likely to flee or
  attack when confronted by one.




  Particularly brave (or foolhardy) individuals sometimes keep cockatrices as pets
  or guard animals. In their natural habitat among plains, forests, and sewers near
  humanoid settlements, cockatrices are content to live off vermin or scraps of waste,
  but their greatest pleasure is consuming warm meals of freshly petrified flesh.

  description: A peck from a cockatrice hardens the flesh of the creature struck.
    The target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become slowed 1 (or slowed
    2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves against calcification increase
    the slowed condition. Once a creature's actions are reduced to 0 by calcification,
    that creature becomes petrified.Every 24 hours after it was petrified, the victim
    can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh
    again, but is slowed 1 for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature
    recovers and isn't slowed. On a failure, the creature remains petrified, but can
    try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent,
    and the creature can't attempt any more saves.
