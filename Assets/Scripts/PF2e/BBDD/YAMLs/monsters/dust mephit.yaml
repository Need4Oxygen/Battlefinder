description: 'Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their
  tendency to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insignificant
  and minor difficulty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making themselves
  out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They tend to
  be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.
