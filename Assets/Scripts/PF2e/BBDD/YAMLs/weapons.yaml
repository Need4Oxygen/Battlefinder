      Sometimes referred to as an alley bow by rogues or ruffians, this small crossbow
      fires small bolts that are sometimes used to deliver poison to the target. It's
      small enough to be shot one-handed, but it still requires two hands to load.

      This projectile weapon is made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together
      to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. Like all longbows,
      its great size also increases the bow's range and power. You must use two hands
      to fire it, and it cannot be used while mounted. Any time an ability is specifically
      restricted to a longbow, such as Erastil's favored weapon, it also applies to
      composite longbows unless otherwise stated.
