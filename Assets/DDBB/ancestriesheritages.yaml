  - descr: The color of your hair and skin is mutable, possibly due to latent magic.
      You can slowly change the vibrancy and the exact color, and the coloration can
      be different across your body, allowing you to create patterns or other colorful
      designs. It takes a single action for minor localized shifts and up to an hour
      for dramatic shifts throughout your body. While you’re asleep, the colors shift
      on their own in tune with your dreams, giving you an unusual coloration each
      morning. When you’re in an area where your coloration is roughly similar to
      the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the single
      action to make minor localized shifts designed to help you blend into your surroundings.
      This grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks until your surroundings
      shift in coloration or pattern.

  - descr: 'You see all colors as brighter, hear all sounds as richer, and especially
      smell all scents with incredible detail. You gain a special sense: imprecise
      scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to
      determine the exact location of a creature (as explained on page 465). The GM
      will usually double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve
      the range if you’re upwind.'
