- descr: 'You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t act. You take a 4
    status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and
    flat-footed conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall prone and drop
    items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM
    determines you’re in a position in which you wouldn’t.


    If you’re unconscious because you’re dying, you can’t wake up while you have 0
    Hit Points. If you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the
    dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.


    If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying, you naturally return
    to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how
    long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If
    you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can
    act normally on your next turn.


    If you’re unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are
    asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways.
    Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.


    - You take damage, provided the damage doesn’t reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If
    the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying
    condition as normal.

    - You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.

    - Someone shakes you awake with an Interact action.

    - There’s loud noise going on around youthough this isn’t automatic. At the start
    of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise’s
    DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed.
    If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses
    their Stealth DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don’t
    allow you to attempt this Perception check.

    - If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have
    had a restful night’s sleep or something disrupted that rest.'

- descr: 'When you are undetected by a creature, that creature cannot see you at all,
    has no idea what space you occupy, and can’t target you, though you still can
    be affected by abilities that target an area. When you’re undetected by a creature,
    that creature is flat-footed to you.


    A creature you’re undetected by can guess which square you’re in to try targeting
    you. It must pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a
    hidden creature (requiring a DC 11 flat check, as described on page 466), but
    the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn’t reveal
    whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll,
    or choosing the wrong square.


    A creature can use the Seek action to try to find you, as described on page 471
    CRB.'

- descr: 'Broken is a condition that affects objects. An object is broken when damage
    has reduced its Hit Points below its Broken Threshold. A broken object can’t be
    used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses-with the exception of
    armor. Broken armor still grants its item bonus to AC, but it also imparts a status
    penalty to AC depending on its category: -1 for broken light armor, -2 for broken
    medium armor, or -3 for broken heavy armor.


    A broken item still imposes penalties and limitations normally incurred by carrying,
    holding, or wearing it. For example, broken armor would still impose its Dexterity
    modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth.


    If an effect makes an item broken automatically and the item has more HP than
    its Broken Threshold, that effect also reduces the item’s current HP to the Broken
    Threshold.'
