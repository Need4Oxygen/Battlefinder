  descr: This armor is simply a layer of heavy, quilted cloth, but it is sometimes
    used because it’s so inexpensive. Padded armor is easier to damage and destroy
    than other types of armor. Heavy armor comes with a padded armor undercoat included
    in its Price, though it loses the comfort trait when worn under heavy armor. You
    can wear just that padded armor undercoat to sleep in, if your heavy armor is
    destroyed, or when otherwise not wearing the full heavy armor. This allows you
    to keep the armor invested and benefit from the power of any runes on the associated
    heavy armor, but no one else can wear your heavy armor without the padded undercoat.
