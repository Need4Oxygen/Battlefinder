trait:
- descr: Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances
    to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item,
    and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with
    the additive trait only when you’re creating an infused alchemical item, and some
    can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action. The additive trait is always followed
    by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the
    alchemical item you’re modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture.
    The mixture’s item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
  name: Additive
  type: None
- descr: Alchemical items are powered by reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical
    items aren’t magical and don’t radiate a magical aura.
  name: Alchemical
  type: None
- descr: When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your
    ability scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18, whichever grants
    the higher score. This gives you all the benefits of the new ability score until
    the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s
    invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item
    at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested,
    you don’t gain the ability score increase, though you do gain any other effects
    of Investing the Item.

  type: None
- descr: Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait
    can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak
    or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory
    trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based
    parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect,
    which still affects targets who can’t hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as
    the effect itself makes sound.
  name: Auditory
  type: None
- descr: An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, af ecting creatures

  type: None
- descr: To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you usually use a type of Performance.
    If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an auditory performance,
    and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a visual one. The spell gains
    all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition
    spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new
    composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end
    immediately.
  name: Composition
  type: None

    Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap.
  name: Curse
  type: None
- descr: Darkness effects extinguish non-magical light in the area, and can counteract
    less powerful magical light. You must usually target light magic with your darkness
    magic directly to counteract the light, but some darkness spells automatically
    attempt to counteract light.
  name: Darkness
  type: None
- descr: An effect with the death trait kills you immediately if it reduces you to

    large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

- descr: An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus
    point is separate from your focus pool and doesn’t count toward the cap on your
    focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there
    might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can’t gain more than 1
    Focus Point per day from focused items.
  name: Focused
  type: None
- descr: A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never
    have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects
    would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune
    effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll
    normally.
  name: Fortune
  type: None
- descr: A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and
    class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this
    trait when your class grants a general feat.
  name: General

- descr: A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic
    death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt’s unfinished
    business. A haunt that hasn’t been properly put to rest always returns after a
    time.
  name: Haunt
  type: None
- descr: A healing effect restores a creature’s body, typically by restoring Hit Points,
    but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.
  name: Healing
  type: None
- descr: An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight
    or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell
    has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s level
    treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as
    one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made
    to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the
    incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard
    generating the effect gains the same benefits.
  name: Incapacitation
  type: None
- descr: An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through
    solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature
    can’t perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it
    starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through
    an incorporeal creature, but they can’t end their movement in its space.
  name: Incorporeal
  type: None
- descr: You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused
    reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent
    effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions
    such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.
  name: Infused
  type: None
- descr: Instinct abilities require a specific instinct; you lose access if you perform
    acts anathema to your instinct.
  name: Instinct
  type: None
- descr: Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract
    magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic
    directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt
    to counteract darkness.
  name: Light
  type: None
- descr: An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic
    effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language
    you are using.
  name: Linguistic

    a single action, that usually give temporary immunity to further litanies.

    with its dominant school of magic.
  name: Magical
  type: None
- descr: You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action
    with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions

  name: Mechanical
  type: None
- descr: A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object
    or a mindless creature.
  name: Mental
  type: None
- descr: Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the
    properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting
    the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and
    reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the
    metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part
    of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
  name: Metamagic
  type: None
- descr: Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with
    this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can’t use reactions. Your minion
    acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue
    it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s
    a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain
    an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command, a single
    action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions
    use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left
    unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t
    act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please.
  name: Minion
  type: None
- descr: A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can
    never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune
    effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune
    effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each
    other out, and you roll normally.
  name: Misfortune
  type: None
- descr: Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any Strikes
    specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple
    morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the
    second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two
    polymorph effects, described in that trait).
  name: Morph
  type: None
- descr: An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another.
  name: Move
  type: None

    into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication
    feat if you are a member of the class of the same name.
  name: Multiclass
  type: None
- descr: Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one
    feat with this trait.
  name: Oath
  type: None
- descr: These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an
    open only if you haven’t used an action with the attack or open trait yet this
    turn.
  name: Open
  type: None
- descr: Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter
    in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.
  name: Plant
  type: None
- descr: These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t be under
    the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the
    effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract
    the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no
    effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect
    are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target
    to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a
    generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
  name: Polymorph
  type: None
- descr: Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into
    a target. A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While
    possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up
    normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter
    the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount
    of damage as mental damage.
  name: Possession
  type: None
- descr: Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait. They
    can be substituted for base materials when you Craft items.
  name: Precious
  type: None
- descr: Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future.
    Most predictions are divinations.
  name: Prediction
  type: None
- descr: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action
    with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple
    attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure.
    The effects that are added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If
    your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead.
    (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)
    Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when
    it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.
  name: Press
  type: None
- descr: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically
    when you stop raging.
  name: Rage
  type: None
- descr: While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged
    weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact
    actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and
    firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions
    to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity,
    or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your
    next turn.
  name: Reload
  type: None
- descr: Effects with this trait see things as they truly are.
  name: Revelation
  type: None
- descr: A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory information
    from a distance using a sensor or apparatus, rather than your own eyes and ears.
  name: Scrying
  type: None
- descr: The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.
  name: Secret
  type: None
- descr: This magic involves shadows or the energy of the Shadow Plane.
  name: Shadow
  type: None
- descr: A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions
    or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when
    a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait
    can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype’s dedication
    feat.
  name: Skill
  type: None
- descr: This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy.
  name: Sleep
  type: None
- descr: When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength
    modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds,
    or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the
    target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure),
    the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together
    with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses
    or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.
  name: Splash
  type: None
- descr: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with
    the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you
    get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter
    ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an
    action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter
    or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
  name: Stance
  type: None
- descr: A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the summoned trait.
    A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast
    spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell
    of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning
    magic, causing the summoned creature’s spell to fail and the summon spell to end.
    Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of
    its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. If you
    can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines
    the degree to which it follows your commands.
  name: Summoned
  type: None
- descr: undefined
  name: Telepathy

- descr: A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder interlopers.
  name: Trap
  type: None
- descr: Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed
    at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical
    success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2.
  name: Virulent
  type: None
- descr: A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only
    to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.

    creature with this trait is chaotic in alignment. An ability with this trait can
    be selected or used only by chaotic creatures.

    or used only by evil creatures.
  name: Evil
