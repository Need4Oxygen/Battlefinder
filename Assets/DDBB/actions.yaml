  descr: You try to help your ally with a task. To use this reaction, you must first
    prepare to help, usually by using an action during your turn. You must explain
    to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help, and they determine whether you can
    Aid your ally.\n\nWhen you use your Aid reaction, attempt a skill check or attack
    roll of a type decided by the GM. The typical DC is 20, but the GM might adjust
    this DC for particularly hard or easy tasks. The GM can add any relevant traits
    to your preparatory action or to your Aid reaction depending on the situation,
    or even allow you to Aid checks other than skill checks and attack rolls.\n\n**Critical
    Success** You grant your ally a +2 circumstance bonus to,the triggering check.
    If you’re a master with the check you,attempted, the bonus is +3, and if you’re
    legendary, it’s +4.\n**Success** You grant your ally a +1 circumstance bonus to
    the triggering check.\n**Critical Failure** Your ally takes a 1 circumstance penalty
    to the triggering check.

    initiative order as a free action triggered by the end of any other creature’s
    turn. This permanently changes your initiative to the new position. You can’t
    use reactions until you return to the initiative order. If you Delay an entire
    round without returning to the initiative order, the actions from the Delayed
    turn are lost, your initiative doesn’t change, and your next turn occurs at your
    original position in the initiative order.\n\nWhen you Delay, any persistent damage
    or other negative effects that normally occur at the start or end of your turn
    occur immediately when you use the Delay action. Any beneficial effects that would
    end at any point during your turn also end. The GM might determine that other
    effects end when you Delay as well. Essentially, you can’t Delay to avoid negative
    consequences that would happen on your turn or to extend beneficial effects that
    would end on your turn.

  descr: You call forth the effect of an item by properly activating it. This is a
    special activity that takes a variable number of actions, as listed in the item’s
    stat block.\n\nSome items can be activated as a reaction or free action. In this
    case, you Activate the Item as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead
    of as an activity. Such cases are noted in the item’s Activate entry in its stat
    blockfor example, “Activate Reaction command.”\n\n**Long Activation Times** Some
    items take minutes or hours to activate. The Activate an Item activity for these
    items includes a mix of the listed activation components, but it’s not necessary
    to break down which one you’re providing at a given time. You can’t use other
    actions or reactions while activating such an item, though at the GM’s discretion,
    you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take
    a long time, these activations have the exploration trait, and you can’t activate
    them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you’re activating one, your activation
    is disrupted (see the Disrupting Activations sidebar).\n\n**Activation Components**
    Each activation entry lists any components involved in the activation after the
    action icons or text, such as “Single Action command.” The activation components,
    described below, add traits (listed in parentheses) and requirements to the activation.
    If you can’t provide the components, you fail to Activate the Item.\n\n- Command
    (auditory, concentrate)\n- Envision (concentrate)\n- Interact (manipulate)\n-
    Cast a Spell\n\n#### Activation Components\n\nAn item’s activate entry lists the
    components required to activate its abilities. Each component adds certain traits
    to the Activate an Item activity, and some components have special requirements.
    The components that appear in this book are listed below.\n\n#####Command\n\nThis
    component is a specific utterance you must make in a loud and strong voice. Activate
    an Item gains the auditory and concentrate traits. You must be able to speak to
    provide this component.\n\n##### Envision\n\nThis component is a specific image
    or phenomenon you need to imagine. Activate an Item gains the concentrate trait.\n\n#####
    Interact\n\nThis component works like the Interact basic action. Activate an Item
    gains the manipulate trait and requires you to use your hands, just like with
    any Interact action.\n\n##### Cast a Spell\n\nIf an item lists “Cast a Spell”
    after “Activate,” the activation requires you to use the Cast a Spell activity
    to Activate the Item. This happens when the item replicates a spell. You must
    have a spellcasting class feature to Activate an Item with this activation component.
    If the item can be used for a specific spell, the action icon for that spell is
    provided. If it’s an item like a staff, which can be used for many spells, the
    icon is omitted, and you must refer to each spell to determine which actions you
    must spend to Activate the Item to cast it.\n\n In this case, Activate an Item
    gains all the traits from the relevant components of the Cast a Spell activity.
  name: Activate an Item
  req: You can Activate an Item with the invested trait only if it’s invested by you.
    If the item requires you to Interact with it, you must be wielding it (if it’s
    a held item) or touching it with a free hand (if it’s another type of item).

  descr: Choose one magic item activation with a sustained duration you have in effect.
    The duration of that activation continues until the end of your next turn. Some
    activations may have slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them.
    Sustaining an Activation for more than 10 minutes (100 rounds) ends the activation
    and makes you fatigued unless the item’s description states a different maximum
    duration (such as “up to 1 minute” or “up to 1 hour”).\n\nIf your Sustain an Activation
    action is disrupted, the item’s effect immediately ends.
  name: Sustain an Activation
  req: You have at least one magic item activation that you can sustain and you are
    not fatigued.

- descr: Basic actions represent common tasks like moving around, attacking, and helping
    others. As such, every creature can use basic actions except in some extreme circumstances,
    and many of those actions are used very frequently. Most notably, you’ll use Interact,
    Step, Stride, and Strike a great deal. Many feats and other actions call upon
    you to use one of these basic actions or modify them to produce different effects.
    For example, a more complex action might let you Stride up to double your Speed
    instead of just up to your Speed, and a large number of activities include a Strike.
