  descr: You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your magical connection.
    This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The deeds you need to perform
    are specified in the class or ability that gives you your focus spells. These
    deeds can usually overlap with other tasks that relate to the source of your focus
    spells. For instance, a cleric with focus spells from a good deity can usually
    Refocus while tending the wounds of their allies, and a wizard of the illusionist
    school might be able to Refocus while attempting to Identify Magic of the illusion
    school.

  descr: You can merge spells, producing multiple effects with a single casting. One
    slot of each level of spell you can cast, except 2nd level and 1st level, becomes
    a spell combination slot (this doesn’t apply to cantrips). When you prepare your
    spells, you can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells. Each
    spell in the combination must be 2 or more spell levels below the slot’s level,
    and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target
    only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the
    same means of determining whether it has an effect—both spells must require a
    ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw, or automatically
    affect the target. When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target,
    even if the component spells normally affect more than one. If any spell in the
    combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only living creatures),
    you must abide by all restrictions. The combined spell uses the shorter of the
    component spells’ ranges. Resolve a combined spell as if were a single spell,
    but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell’s target
    succeeded at the save against a combined spell, it would apply the success effect
    of each spell, and if it critically failed, it would apply the critical failure
    effect of both spells.

    If you’re a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you’re
    legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item
    from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception

  descr: Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed at a DC 10 Society
    check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward
    you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC’s disposition.
    For instance, if you’re well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures
    might be intimidated by you, rather than be friendly toward you. When you Earn
    Income with Performance, you attract higher-level audiences than your location
    would allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and angels might
    travel to your small tower in the woods to hear you perform. Typically, this increases
    the audiences available by 2 levels or more, determined by the GM.

    5 minutes per spell level, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell
    level. You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if
    you were using Earn Income with the tradition’s associated skill, but instead
    of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount
    on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its

  descr: You learn the sign languages associated with the languages you know, allowing
    you to sign and understand signs. Sign languages typically require both hands
    to convey more complex concepts, and they are visual rather than auditory. Sign
    language is difficult to understand during combat due to the level of attention
    needed, unlike basic gestures like pointing at a foe to suggest a target. Sign
    language is hard to use in areas of low visibility, just like speech is difficult
    in a noisy environment.
