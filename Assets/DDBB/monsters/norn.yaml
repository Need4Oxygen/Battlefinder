description: "Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their\
  \ hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread.\
  \ They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called uponâ€”or with\
  \ a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.\n\
  \n\n\nNorns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among\
  \ norns serve __Magdh__ the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be\
  \ the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three\
  \ bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads\
  \ of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in\
  \ her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands\
  \ to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings\
  \ in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk\
  \ at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more\
  \ alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest\
  \ wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle\
  \ with fate as much as they desire.\n\n\n\nWhile even the weakest of the Eldest\
  \ could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations\
  \ and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use\
  \ their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many\
  \ demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired\
  \ of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated\
  \ norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely\
  \ a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start\
  \ acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most\
  \ disruptive actions.\n\n\n\nA norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.\n\
  \n\n\n\n\n## Worshipping Norns\n\n On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns\
  \ as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons\
  \ or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as __Followers of Fate__.\
  \ Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their\
  \ way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific\
  \ norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits\
  \ regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair\
  \ of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate,\
  \ and the aging process.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fey__ (__Nature__)**: DC\
