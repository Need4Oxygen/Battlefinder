description: 'Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They
  are loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking
  to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halflings, often utilize
  ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other Medium
  humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are domesticated, though
  large herds of these powerful animals can be found in the wild.
