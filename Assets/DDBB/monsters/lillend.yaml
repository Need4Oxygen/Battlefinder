description: 'Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of
  expression. They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece
  of art is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring
  mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard
  looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly follow
  the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems and songs,
  which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When pursuing such
  goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in hiding, as they
  would rather observe and record events without "polluting" them with their own intervention.
  Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced with certain death often cannot
  resist the urge to intervene and save the day. Inevitably, this brings a close to
  the lillend''s chronicles, as their relationship with their subject invariably shifts
  from one of detached observation to friendship or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant
  to involve themselves for overlong in a mortal''s life, in part because they fear
  what sort of fiendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out of
  respect for the mortal''s own destiny. A lillend would, all things being equal,
  prefer to let mortals choose their own fate rather than run the risk of sending
  someone down a path to which their heart is not set.
