description: 'In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible
  place similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live
  out lives of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough
  to think they can benefit from the spirit naga''s powers without paying a heavy
  priceâ€”for most who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.




  Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and corruption.
  These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled
  fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little
  of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the
  psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth
  and stones there.




  Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit
  nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences.
  They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are revealed
  only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of "civilized" society.
  Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship of other creatures willing to
  bow to their capricious whims. They often form cults around themselves, using their
  charm spells and rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread
  the nagas'' foul influence throughout a community.
