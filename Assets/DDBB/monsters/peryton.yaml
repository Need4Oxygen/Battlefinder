description: 'The peryton is an amalgam of horror, merging the features of a stag,
  wolf, and hawk. They love using shadows to stalk their victims before ripping out
  their still-beating hearts and relishing the dying pulse as they swallow them whole,
  so the doomed victims spends their last moments watching as their flesh is consumed.




  Despite perytons'' animalistic appearance and brutal behavior, they are viciously
  cunning and as intelligent as humans. Their preferred tactic is to find a lone traveler
  and stalk it from on high. Most perytons are loners who loathe all other creatures.
  These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult males attack each other
  on sight as surely as they attack anything else.




  Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have collected from
  humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to secure a mate rarely survive
  long though, as their mating ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally
  abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched perytons must fend for themselves
  from the moment they emerge.




  A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky overhang or an exceptionally tall
  and strong tree where they can observe nearby lands. Although they aren''t particularly
  interested in wealth, perytons do like to collect small objects from their victims.
  During those times between hunts, they sometimes study these trophies in order to
  relive the memories of victims'' last moments and the taste of victims'' hearts.

    it''s already frightened. This is an __emotion__ and __fear__ effect. The shadow
