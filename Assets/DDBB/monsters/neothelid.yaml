description: 'This gigantic, mauve worm has a hooked mouth with multiple circular
  bands of teeth and four barbed tongues. A wielder of terrible occult powers and
  a vast alien intellect, the neothelid serves the ageless horrors that dwell in strange
  dimensions beyond known reality—the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos.
  Neothelids pass down these mysteries to the eerie wormlike creatures they spawn
  and create in preparation for a future where the worms below shall rule—a time when
  all other life is nothing more than food.
