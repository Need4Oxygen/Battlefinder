description: 'Harpies are filthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral
  humans with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating
  songs to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transfixed. They enjoy
  causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates
  a savory flavor in the flesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer
  sapient preyâ€”humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins
  if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible.
  This doesn''t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of
  harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless
  spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate
  with danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep
  clean, though these efforts have mixed results.




  Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They are lightweight despite their
  size, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use relatively
  simple weapons, some harpies take pride in learning and mastering the use of more
  complex tools of war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of the
  bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among their kind and terrors among
  their victims.
