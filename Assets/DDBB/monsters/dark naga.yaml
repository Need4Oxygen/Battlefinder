description: 'Dark nagas are wicked, jealous creatures that crave power and wealth.
  Indeed, the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential
  truth: if one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga
  sees other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must
  be eliminated.




  Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken, searching abandoned
  ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those unlucky trespassers into a dark naga''s
  lair typically find themselves as the naga''s slaves or playthings, put to sleep
  with the monster''s poison or incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are
  more disposed toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become wicked
  despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting subjects. Subtler dark
  nagas, especially those who crave finer luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy
  settlements and use their wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something
  akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object of worship.
