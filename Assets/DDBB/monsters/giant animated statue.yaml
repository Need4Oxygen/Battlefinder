    reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an giant
    animated statue is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon
    being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class

description: 'As with any humanoid animated statues of Medium size, giant animated
  statues are used to guard locations of importance, but their increased size and
  power make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations.
  Animated objects of this strength and size are ideal for tasks and responsibilities
  usually performed by golems, and more powerful animated objects are thus all but
  unheard of.

  description: The statue carries a wide brazier full of hot coals. To make flaming
    coal Strikes or use Burn Alive, the statue must have the brazier held in one hand
    or otherwise have it within reach. Instead of targeting the statue with an attack,
    a creature can target the brazier directly. The brazier has the same AC and saves
    as the statue. Dealing 15 cold damage to the brazier or dousing it with at least
    2 gallons of water extinguishes the coals. This prevents the statue from using
    Burn Alive and causes its ranged attacks to no longer deal 2d8 fire damage.
