description: 'Xulgath physiological diversity doesn''t always imply drastic change;
  some xulgaths are simply much larger and stronger than their clutchmates. Most xulgaths
  call such siblings spinesnappers, though terms like bonebreaker, marrowvent, or
  similarly violent epithets are equally common. A typical spinesnapper is 9 feet
  tall and weighs 350 pounds.




  In battle, spinesnappers have all the speed, grace, and strength of a sledgehammer.
  They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch
  conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the
  challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares
  off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes
  off some of the loser''s scales as a trophy.
