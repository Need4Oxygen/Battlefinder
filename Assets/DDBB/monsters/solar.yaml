  description: 20 feet. Allies in the solar's aura gain a +2 status bonus to AC against
    evil creatures and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects from evil creatures.
    The bonus increases to +4 against control by evil creatures and attacks by evil
    summoned creatures. When the solar or an ally is hit by an attack from a creature
    in the aura, that foe must succeed at a DC 43 Will save or be blinded for 1 minute
    (this is an __incapacitation__ effect). It's then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

description: 'Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just below empyreal
  lords. Many solars serve at the right hand of a deity or champion a cause that benefits
  an entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but not allâ€”they can adopt
  more unusual forms as needed. A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about
  500 pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery
  or golden skin.




  Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them are said to be able to
  follow the centuries-old passage of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane.
