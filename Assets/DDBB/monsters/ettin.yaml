description: 'Two heads aren''t always better than one. The slovenly, violent giants
  known as ettins are proof enough of that.




  The origin of these two-headed brutes is unknown, but few who encounter ettins ponder
  their beginnings for long. Rather, the first priority for most creatures during
  such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the ettins''
  notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one—ettins regularly
  find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits
  of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin
  requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes
  make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either.
  The ettin''s two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves,
  and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn''t dream of life without the other.
  Much like some twins, an ettin has two individual minds who nonetheless consider
  the other as much a part of their life as their own self.




  Ettins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation of several.
  Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size and dimness
  suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins and hobgoblins, ettins
  are more than at home among tribes of these creatures and enjoy their comfortable
  stations as camp lookouts or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety
  of goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins speak a pidgin tongue
  of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish, and their diction is mostly good enough to get across
  the general meaning of their short sentences and bumbled sayings—although most interlocutors
  simply nod their heads while conversing with an ettin anyway. The monsters are notoriously
  short tempered and, despite their heightened visual perception, short sighted in
  matters of keeping their allies alive.
