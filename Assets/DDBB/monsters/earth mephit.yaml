description: 'Earth mephits are humorless and trudge about their tasks with little
  enthusiasm. They are somewhat more stout than other mephits, and their dark-brown
  or gray bodies are always coated with layers of dirt and filth. An earth mephit
  can fly, just as any other mephit, but the act of flight is uncomfortable and unnerving
  to themâ€”they rarely ascend higher than 5 feet off the ground if they can help it.
