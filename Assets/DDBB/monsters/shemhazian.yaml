description: 'Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in
  mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a shemhazian
  is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to continue inflicting
  such torments on those it encounters.




  Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but more than most
  demons, these fiends revel in sharing the pain with their own kind. Other demons
  fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with only the most powerful willing to
  work with a shemhazian to achieve a shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always
  on the watch for an opportunity to bring pain and suffering to its allies along
  with any foe.
