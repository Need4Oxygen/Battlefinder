description: 'The isqulug''s appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful
  aspect. The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms
  and a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy transparent
  eggs filled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute the mind and
  consciousness of the isqulugâ€”its "body" is little more than an organic suit manufactured
  from the flesh of those it has consumed, analogous to the complex web of a spider
  or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of movement and violence.
