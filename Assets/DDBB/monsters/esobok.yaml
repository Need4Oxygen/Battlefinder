description: 'Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the
  guard dogs of the __Boneyard__. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of
  dark feathers around their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks
  rarely bother with those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to
  go about their business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when
  sniffing out threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they''re among
  the least intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling
  threats. The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won''t do so twice.
