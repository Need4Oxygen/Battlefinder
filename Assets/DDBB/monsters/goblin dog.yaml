description: 'Goblins'' eponymous pets aren''t true canines at all, but rather large,
  blunt-nosed rodents with thin bodies and long legs. As cowardly as they are ugly,
  goblin dogs prefer to lurk behind bushes or in deep shadows, pouncing upon lone
  or wounded prey. Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely
  to flee from a fight if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates.




  Goblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who breed
  the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with the name, as
  the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their favored mounts,
  have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven''t
  bothered to come up with their own, unique name for goblin dogs.




  Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and prolific dander that tenaciously
  affects those who come in contact with them. This "goblin pox" causes itchy hives
  and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are irritating and distracting.
  Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly all other creatures that don''t
  share the goblin dogs'' terrible hygieneâ€”with the notable exception, of course,
  of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the disease regardless of cleanliness.




  Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many goblins
  purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle. Goblin dogs
  subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they particularly enjoy
  fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters, they value goblin dogs
  as pets because the noisome animals will consume food that even goblins won''t dare
  to eat. "Will it eat?" is one of several games goblins enjoy playing with their
  goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-sized morsels (not always edible or
  safe to consume) are dangled before a goblin dog''s snout. "Will it die?" is often
  a game played after "Will it eat?" Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn
  renown for their digestive prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated
  better than most of the rank-and-file goblins.
