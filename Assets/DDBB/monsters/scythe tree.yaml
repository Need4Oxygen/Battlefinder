description: 'Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near
  deep forest paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance
  from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the flesh, blood, and bone
  of sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted
  gnome or an altruistic __dryad__ who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed.
  The screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add
  an extra dimension of flavor to the meal.




  Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean that
  they don''t need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once food sources
  dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree
  dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and
  roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a
  new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new
  hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.




  Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches
  that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that
  is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain
  attached year-round. Scythe trees'' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating,
  appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their
  voices are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when discussing arboreals, whom
  scythe trees universally find to be insufferable and worthy of little more than
  being hacked to pieces.
