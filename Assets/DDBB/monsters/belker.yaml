    save. On a failure, the creature partially inhales the belker and is __immobilized__
    by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and lungs. The creature can attempt
    to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing and succeeding at a DC 23
    Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the creature, so the belker
    can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature''s space or uses
    Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it.'
