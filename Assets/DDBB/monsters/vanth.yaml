description: 'Protecting the __Boneyard__ are the stern and resolute guardians of
  the dead known as vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings
  and a mask resembling a vulture''s skull. Vanths carry black scythes to fight against
  those who would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any
  visitor to the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go
  to war, vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely
  show any emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.
