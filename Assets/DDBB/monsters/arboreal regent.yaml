description: 'Arboreal regents—also called treants—are lumbering, solitary creatures
  responsible for guarding an entire forest. They take an especially long view of
  affairs and never act brashly or without much deliberation. They occasionally come
  together in small groups called groves to share news and pass their wisdom down
  to the arboreal wardens that have sprouted under their watch. In times of grave
  danger, all the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting to
  plan and, eventually, act upon a threat.


  The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and
  weighs 4,500 pounds.
