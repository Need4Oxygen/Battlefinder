description: 'Though they''re often mistaken for __vampires__ in gaseous form or an
  unusual type of __air elemental__, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms.
  With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, these creatures
  dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat isn''t
  as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas,
  as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While
  blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these
  sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures.
  Like __will-o''-wisps__, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though
  they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.




  Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes
  group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together.
  Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they approach with
  great creativity. The mists'' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of
  the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors
  that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using
  this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics—such
  as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use positive energy against them as
  if they were undead monsters.
