  description: Barb only. A hamatula gains an extra reaction at the start of each
    of its turns that it can use only to make an __Attack of Opportunity__. It can't
    use more than one Attack of Opportunity triggered by the same action. In addition
    to the normal trigger, a hamatula can make an Attack of Opportunity against a
    creature that touches it or an adjacent creature that attempts a melee Strike
    against it.
  effect: You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against
    the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was
    a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward
    your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to
    this Strike.

description: 'Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to protect infernal vaults from those
  foolish enough to try to rob the archdevil __Mammon__. In case the vicious spines
  protruding from their bodies and ability to teleport weren''t deadly enough, they
  are also clever wielders of warding glyphs. They are effective conjured guardians,
  though they resent being pulled away from their duties in __Hell__. Unlike most
  fiends, hamatulas are formed from several souls that lack any features distinctive
  enough to merit another role.
