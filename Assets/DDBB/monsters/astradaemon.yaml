description: 'These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct
  assault against a soul or life-forceâ€”the same numbing death they bring with their
  fell touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their
  time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they
  capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments
  and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters. These horrifying
  predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls
  in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims. Psychopomps have
  a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and these
  eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend.




  Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind
  serve the Horsemen themselves as assassins.
