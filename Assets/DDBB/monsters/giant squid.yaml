  description: The giant squid makes up to four arm Strikes, each with a different
    arm and against a different target. The giant squid then makes a beak Strike against
    one creature that it __grabbed__ during Ravenous Embrace. Each arm Strike counts
    separately for the squid's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase
    until the squid has made all of its arm Strikes; the beak Strike uses the multiple
    attack penalty as normal.
