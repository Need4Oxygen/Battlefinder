description: 'Ether spiders are deadly predators from the Ethereal Plane resembling
  giant arachnids. Rather than building webs of silk, ether spiders shape the raw
  essence of the Ethereal Plane, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through
  the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can scout
  the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners of
  the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its nest
  and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its victim
  is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane, clamps its fangs
  onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its venom works
  through the creature''s system. Ether spiders move between the planes with ease,
  making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot see or attack ethereal enemies.




  Ether spiders are not mindless or evilâ€”they are simply hungry. If a prospective
  meal can sate an ether spider''s incredible appetite through other means, they might
  be able to bargain for their life. Ether spiders are especially interested in items,
  information, or allies who can help them against their enemies.




  As many as half a dozen ether spiders might dwell in the same ether web. Although
  ether spiders enjoy one another''s company, they don''t form the same bonds as most
  humanoids, and they are more likely to feast on the corpse of a fallen sibling than
  save one from certain doom.




  Ether spiders dwell in vast nests adrift in the Ghost World, where they are more
  likely to let down their guard. Travelers who find a floating ether spider commune
  should have an easier time of making peaceful contact to trade with or even befriend
  these strange arachnids. The nests drift on metaphysical currents and are rarely
  seen in the same vicinity twice. Sometimes a point of interest on the neighboring
  Material Plane compels them to tether their nest to an area, creating a semipermanent
  home, and those who learn its location can return to it repeatedly.
