description: 'Mean, dog-faced, and craven, pugwampis take disproportionate enjoyment
  from the accidents and missteps of other creaturesâ€”something that happens often
  due to the supernatural aura of ill fortune these gremlins project. They enjoy preparing
  pranks involving spikes, excrement, pits full of spiders, and the like. Pugwampis
  are somewhat deaf and thus often yell loudly to each other when not hiding. Many
  pugwampis worship gnolls as gods and aspire to be more like gnolls, although gnolls
  hate pugwampis even more than most creatures do, due to their sycophantic fawning.
