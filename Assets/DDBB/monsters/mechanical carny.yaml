  description: A severely damaged mechanical carny has a chance of malfunctioning.
    If a mechanical carny has 15 or fewer Hit Points at the start of its turn, it
    must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or go haywire. A haywire mechanical carny wildly
    attacks the nearest living creature, or the nearest object if no creatures are
    nearby. It takes a -1 circumstance penalty to Strikes but deals an additional
    1d6 bludgeoning damage plus __Knockdown__. This effect lasts 10 minutes or until
    the mechanical carny is destroyed.

description: "Mechanical carnies are constructs manufactured to serve as entertainers,\
  \ cleaners, and guards at carnivals and circuses. The first of these constructs\
  \ was created by a gnome inventor who yearned for a tireless companion who could\
  \ make her laugh and smile. Her invention was so successful that it has spawned\
  \ countless imitations and knockoffs throughout the Inner Sea, and mechanical carnies\
  \ of some form or another are a staple throughout metropolitan lands in both Avistan\
  \ and Garund. \n\n## Other Mechanical Carnies\n\n The statistics here represent\
  \ a relatively simple mechanical carny; the extravagance and range of a mechanical\
  \ carny's abilities are limited only by the skill and imagination of its creator.\
  \ To represent other kinds of mechanical carnies, you can swap out the mechanical\
  \ carny's Berserk and Berserk Slam abilities with one of the following.\n\n\n\n\
  **Bounce Back** [Reaction] **Requirement** The mechanical carny takes damage from\
  \ a melee attack; **Effect** The mechanical carny wobbles violently to and fro,\
  \ making two headbutt Strikes: the first against the creature (if any) on the opposite\
  \ side of itself from the creature that triggered this reaction and the second against\
  \ the creature that triggered this reaction.\n\n\n\n**Spring-Loaded Jump**  (__move__)\
  \ The mechanical carny leaps up to 25 feet into the air and lands within 25 feet\
  \ (or a distance equal to the height of the carny's jump, if fewer) of where it\
  \ started, taking no falling damage.\n\n\n\n**Water Cannon**  (__water__) The mechanical\
  \ carny sprays a 15-foot cone of water, dealing 2d6+4 nonlethal bludgeoning to creatures\
  \ in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and extinguishing any non-magical fires.\n\
  \n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Construct__ (__Arcana__, __Crafting__)**: DC 16"
