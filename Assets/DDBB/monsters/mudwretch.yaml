description: 'In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick,
  dark mud, heaped at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living
  creature approaches, though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy flesh
  upon itself to form a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching
  creature''s general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.




  Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies
  or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements.
  They have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch
  dries out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood
  from living creatures has to doâ€”a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders
  than one that''s comfortably wallowing on a river bank.
