description: 'Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the
  most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly
  creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go
  off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists,
  guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons
  are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade
  for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their
  protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.




  Bronze dragons'' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are
  a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon''s enemies quickly discover
  neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons
  lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.




  While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles
  a vast libraryâ€”with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In
  addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated
  with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid
  with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.
