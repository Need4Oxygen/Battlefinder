description: 'Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of
  their species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored
  scales and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted
  to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps
  to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a
  particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragonsâ€”a notable exception to
  the norm for drakes and dragons.

  description: A shadow drake spits a ball of black liquid that explodes into a cloud

    burst. Creatures within the burst take 3d6 cold damage (DC 18 basic Reflex save).
    The explosion of shadow also snuffs out mundane light sources the size of a torch,
    lantern, or smaller, and attempts to counteract magical light with a +10 counteract
    modifier. The shadow drake can't use Shadow Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
