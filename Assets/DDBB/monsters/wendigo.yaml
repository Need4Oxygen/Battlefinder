  effect: The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up to 1 mile away.
    Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be frightened
    1. Any creature that critically fails and is within 120 feet of the wendigo is
    instead frightened 3, and is also fleeing for 1d4 rounds (or until it's no longer
    frightened, whichever comes first). A creature frightened by a wendigo's howl
    still naturally recovers from its fright but can't reduce it below frightened
    1 in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is used. Whether it succeeds or
    fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to that wendigo's Howl for
    24 hours.

  effect: The wendigo attempts to turn the grabbed creature into wind and carry it
    along as part of the action. If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will save, it prevents
    itself from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms, automatically
    releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride the Wind along with the wendigo
    is exposed to wendigo torment. The target can attempt a new Will save each round
    to return to normal, though it immediately becomes corporeal and begins falling
    if it succeeds.
