description: 'Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength
  in many cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion
  and the head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but
  some instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In
  rare cases, the griffon''s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great
  cat, such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment
  in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern
  Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy owl—though
  this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether. These wingless
  griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a clutch of other griffons,
  the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these offshoots survive their
  fledgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood tend to be tougher, more
  violent, and more aloof than most griffons.




  Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen eyesight
  to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground and grab up
  their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim''s flesh with their razor-sharp
  beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded location where they
  can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground, they take cover and
  leap out to ambush prey, then fly off with their prize. The exception to this is
  when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case it will almost never
  purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear of endangering its
  chicks.




  Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts for military
  forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their strength, bravery,
  and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals and possess a wisdom
  not normally afforded most animals; it is thought that a griffon chooses its rider
  as much as a rider chooses the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept
  and carry a rider in flight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers charge
  rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can boast of owning a stable of griffons
  is the subject of great respect and envy.
