description: 'Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o''-wisps haunt lonely marshes
  and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o''-wisps can
  vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns
  or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They
  can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing
  so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in
  the distance isn''t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a
  will-o''-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and
  dread felt by its victims.




  Beneath its glow, a will-o''-wisp''s body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot
  in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o''-wisps are merely
  translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination
  they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed
  closely. Will-o''-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the
  ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in
  the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead
  that produce terror in their victims. Will-o''-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively
  immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o''-wisp can be
  a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such
  a sinister monster is no easy feat.




  Will-o''-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight
  and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal
  areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over
  a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and
  dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o''-wisps, different types of fear have
  subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws
  at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they''re lost produces a much
  different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a
  towering monster. Because of this, will-o''-wisps try to vary the ways in which
  they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don''t tire of certain flavors
  of fear.
