description: 'Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation
  of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is a constant
  state of flux between these two poles, their forms a shifting cloak of black where
  galaxies and other celestial objects flit in and out of existence, as if depicting
  the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.




  Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable,
  ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They believe the current Convergence
  is necessary to obtain this essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand
  design of the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.

  description: Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere
    of white energy that hovers above its left hand. By using a single action, which
    has the __concentrate__ trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet.
    The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can't
    move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma. Wherever the sphere travels,
    it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain
    (the pleroma's choice of normal, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) or a
    5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood,
    or stone). The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature
    must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful
    save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM's choice away from the sphere.
    Those who fail take 20d6 positive damage (even if they are living) and are pushed
    away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage
    from a failure, become one with the new material and can be restored only via
    a 10th-level spell. A pleroma can have only one Sphere of Creation in existence
    at a time, and the sphere automatically vanishes in a flash of blinding light
    after 1d4 minutes. All creatures within 30 feet of the sphere of creation when
    it vanishes must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be permanently __blinded__.

  description: Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere
    of complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right hand. It can move and
    control the sphere in the same manner as its Sphere of Creation. The sphere is
    an empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing in on itself and winking
    out of existence. Once manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged attack,
    but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any
    unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed.
    Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot
    cube per round of contact. The sphere can enter the space of a creature, with
    effects similar to the Sphere of Creation except that it deals negative damage
    (even to undead) on a failure and annihilates rather than incorporating the creature
    into material. Such a destroyed creature can be restored only by a 10th-level
    spell.
