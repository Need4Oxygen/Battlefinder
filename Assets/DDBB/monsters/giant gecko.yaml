description: 'These roughly human-sized reptiles have amazing feet capable of clinging
  tenaciously to any surface. Giant geckos are typically docile and shy but can be
  aggressive when cornered or defending their territory. These large-eyed lizards
  are found in a wide variety of habitats, from rainforests and deserts to mountain
  slopes or even underground caverns. They spend most of their time climbing around
  in large trees or on rocky cliffs, whether hunting for small animals or hiding from
  predators. A giant gecko''s scales are often quite brightly colored or decorated
  in intricate patterns. Giant geckos span nearly 8 feet in length from head to tail,
  and they weigh about 120 pounds.




  Giant geckos are sometimes used by smaller humanoids as guardians or mounts, as
  their docile nature makes them relatively easy to tame and train. Their superior
  climbing skills make giant geckos particularly popular within societies that dwell
  underground or near cliffs, such as goblins and kobolds. Their bright coloration
  also makes them favorite exotic pets in high society.
