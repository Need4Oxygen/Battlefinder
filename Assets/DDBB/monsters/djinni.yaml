description: 'Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture, knowledge,
  and trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady wines. Of
  all geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals, interacting
  with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie heritage and
  have a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has earned them a
  reputation for arrogance.


  Djinn get along with jann and marids, but they find shaitans too stiff and harbor
  undying hatred for efreet. Although djinn are formidable combatants, they despise
  war and prefer to eschew violence in favor of dealing with their opponents using
  magic or subterfuge (making an exception, of course, when they encounter efreet).
