description: 'Of all the ways to die, crucidaemons represent perhaps one of the least
  desirable: death by torture. The fiend''s shapely body, which appears to be sculpted
  from iron or mithril, belies a sinister wrath and love of inflicting pain. Crucidaemons
  particularly enjoy inflicting pain with their curved, serrated daggers, which are
  attached to their bodies via a chain that pierces each wrist.




  A crucidaemon''s existence is dedicated to subjecting its prey to an eternity of
  pain and terror. Unlike other daemons, many of which are eager to feed on mortal
  souls as soon as they can, the crucidaemon takes much greater pleasure in prolonging
  the agony of its victims. Oftentimes, a crucidaemon will inflict such torment and
  pain upon its prey that when the end finally comes, the victim tearfully thanks
  the daemon for the mercy of oblivion. An encounter with a crucidaemon that does
  not end with its death is far from overâ€”crucidaemons have unequaled patience for
  those who dare oppose them.
