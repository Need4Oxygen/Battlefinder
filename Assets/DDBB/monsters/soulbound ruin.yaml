description: 'Those who tread in ruined places sometimes speak of a sense that a supernatural
  presence is there alongside them, as if the spirits of the dead were watching intently.
  Such presences can be very real, often taking the form of ghosts or other shades
  of undead that cannot let go of their attachment to the Material Plane. But sometimes,
  instead of manifesting as distinct spirits, the souls of the dead infuse the very
  stone and mortar around them. When enough souls attach themselves to a single place—be
  it a home, crypt, or castle—it can take on a life of its own, becoming a soulbound
  ruin.
