description: 'Ceustodaemons are formed from the souls of vile mortals, particularly
  those who took efforts to hasten their own death, their willingness shaping them
  into daemonic servants. Their otherworldly senses make them useful for protecting
  vaults and similar locations on the Material Plane. Ceustodaemons are created to
  serve, but always seek ways to subvert their bindings, so they can rend their mortal
  summoners'' flesh. The worst type of conjurer calls upon ceustodaemons merely to
  set them free into the world in hopes of currying favor with the powers of Abaddon.
