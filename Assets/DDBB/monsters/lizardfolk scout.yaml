description: 'Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers,
  for these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly
  patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it
  is the responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn
  their ways and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense
  against potential reprisals.
