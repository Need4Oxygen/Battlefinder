description: 'A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike
  legs, and its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness
  it. Hives of these skittering monsters haunt the lowest reaches of the Darklands,
  competing with cave worms and other subterranean horrors for food and resources.
  A gogiteth is rarely seen alone, as these oversized vermin learned long ago that
  the best means of survival is sticking close to others of their own kind. Even the
  haughty drow know to seek cover when a gogiteth is spotted, for where there is one,
  a swarm is sure to follow.




  Gogiteths make a clacking sound as they move about. The joints in their many legs
  pop and crack with each movement, though they can suppress this sound voluntarily
  so that they can hunt without giving away their presence. The odd creatures can
  also make a high-pitched whistling sound that echoes throughout the caverns where
  they live. Some Darklands natives report that groups of gogiteths sometimes join
  together in eerie, discordant songs.




  Gogiteths'' alien anatomies have inspired no shortage of speculative origin stories.
  Some believe they are the result of a fleshwarping experiment gone horribly wrong.
  Others think they may be related in some way to the Dominion of the Blackâ€”possibly
  the distant cousins or some strange exile of that alien entity; according to this
  mythos, once they made their way to this planet, the gogiteths crawled into the
  depths of the earth, shying away from the blazing sun above.




  Gogiteths are a menace to every other denizen of the Darklands. Drow and duergars
  in gogiteth-infested regions of Sekamina or Orv frequently organize hunting parties
  to eradicate the terrors, even calling for temporary truces with unlikely allies
  in times when a gogiteth presence must be addressed. Since even an average gogiteth
  hive can host up to two dozen of the horrors, missions to eradicate them when they
  become established are dangerous quests indeed.
