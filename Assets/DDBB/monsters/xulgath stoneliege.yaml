description: 'Stonelieges are xulgaths magically infused with living earthâ€”the very
  bones of the world. They are created through a process xulgaths call stone-binding,
  which can be performed with complex alchemy, powerful psychic magic, or Abyssal
  rituals. Their scales are like stone slabs, and their bones are as dense as bedrock,
  so they are among the hardiest and longest-lived xulgaths. To stonelieges, earth
  is as mutable as water, and their innate power to shape the soil and stone beneath
  their feet makes them integral members of xulgath society (as well as formidable
  combatants).
