description: 'Found in warm and tropical forests and savannas, these immense lizards
  are a deadly threat to the unsuspecting traveler. When they aren''t sleeping or
  stalking prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers
  sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their large size, elaborate
  neck frills (which, when displayed in a show of aggression and dominance, can be
  mistaken for wings), and ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures
  too large to eat.




  A giant frilled lizard''s primary food sources are oversized arthropods and other
  invertebrates, but it won''t hesitate to augment its diet with vertebrates, including
  other lizards, monkeys, and just about anything it can flt into its mouthâ€”even humanoids.
  Although capable of short bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies
  perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush its prey.
