description: 'These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled
  areas like cities, but ankhravs'' predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh
  ensures that the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate
  farmers whose fields become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but
  to seek the aid of adventurers.
