description: 'Soulbound dolls are eerie mannequins or playthings that have been imbued
  with a small piece of a deceased mortal''s soul. These little constructs are created
  for a variety of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their free
  will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma
  generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle
  of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound
  doll, regardless of the construct''s alignment, as an important service to the Great
  Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including
  human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound
  terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and
  an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the
  creator''s Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor''s death. A non-evil
  doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such
  use before their death occurred




  Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort;
  despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment''s power makes the doll''s flst
  more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll
  a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and
  remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters
  as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems,
  allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though
  soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after
  a person''s death, this doesn''t affect the deceased''s resurrection or progress
  to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective
  soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone
  to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.




  The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem (Hardness 10) typically embedded in
  the doll''s neck or chest. The soul fragment isn''t static, and the doll continues
  to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change,
  possibly growing closer to the donor''s or moving farther a  eld on its own individual
  path. The soulbound doll''s focus gem retains the doll''s memories even after the
  doll''s destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even
  be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound
  creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.
