  description: 60 feet. A bogeyman's aura of terror manifests as a shifting haze of
    images that reflect the viewers' deepest fears. Whenever a creature ends its turn
    within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or become __frightened 1__.
    A creature's frightened condition (including from striking fear) does not reduce
    as long as the creature remains in the aura. If the creature succeeds at its saving
    throw, it becomes temporarily immune to the aura for 24 hours.

description: 'These nocturnal stalkers tail their chosen quarry for days, even weeks
  at a time, ominously showing up in back alleys, shadowy street corners, and even
  in victims'' own homes before going in for the kill. For unfathomable reasons, a
  bogeyman may spare a victim''s life and instead kidnap them, absconding to a far-off
  location before returning years later with a fresh bogey in tow.
