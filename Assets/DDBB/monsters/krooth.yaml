description: 'Krooths, sometimes called crocodile eaters, are fast and vicious hunters
  of bogs and wetlands. While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators,
  and virtually any creature with flesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards,
  and dinosaurs.




  Krooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial creaturesâ€”fierce,
  bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are likely to shy away
  from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened.
  Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise
  their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack
  watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process
  is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group
  for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in an orgiastic frenzy that can last
  for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their
  mate and devour his nutrient-rich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs
  contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay
  handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange
  properties of the creature''s blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous,
  hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes
  the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth.




  Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially
  that of bugbears. This doesn''t mean krooths won''t kill goblinoids, especially
  those threatening their young, but they typically do so using only their claws and
  tails, and they take great care to clean themselves thoroughly after such a killing.
