description: 'These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down
  and slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they
  prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work
  to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature
  can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to
  perform nature''s dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters,
  and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work
  or travel within.




  Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives
  them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like
  blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and
  stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous
  scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds
  where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though
  grimstalkers tend to treat these "pets" poorly at best.




  There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other feyâ€”for the most part,
  grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps
  both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers
  consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.




  Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They
  surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling
  out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers
  won''t stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These
  violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each
  grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding
  creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars
  theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who
  were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it''s just part of what makes a grimstalker
  what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.
