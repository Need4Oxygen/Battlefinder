description: 'Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons
  terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their
  fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with
  a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures
  is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons
  of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual
  enemy.




  Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them
  to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited
  to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They''re immune to the fetid
  water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.




  Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting
  meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted
  roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes.
  Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense,
  twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist
  of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can''t survive
  the dragon''s acidic presence.
