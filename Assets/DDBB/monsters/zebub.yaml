description: 'Zebubs serve as __Hell''s__ messengers and spies. Their ability to share
  what they''ve seen with other creatures makes them especially usefulâ€”not only to
  other devils, but also to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in
  enormous, horrid swarms upon unsuspecting lands to debase flesh and land alike while
  collecting secrets the infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity
  to manipulate weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs'' whims.
  While arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and confidence of most devils,
  and thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive
  ambitions. Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by
  the archdevil Baalzebul in the frozen, filthy wastes of Hell''s seventh layer, Cocytus.
