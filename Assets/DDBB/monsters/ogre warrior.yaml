description: 'The simplest of ogres are slabs of muscle with hatefully beady eyes,
  misshapen visages, and malformed bodies. Always eager for mayhem and murder, ogre
  warriors are quick to turn on their kin when there''s a shortage of smaller folk
  to torment, so those who lead ogres do their best to keep them constantly distracted
  with new opportunities for raids and ruin.
