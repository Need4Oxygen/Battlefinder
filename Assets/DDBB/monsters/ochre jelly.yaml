  description: Whenever an ochre jelly is hit by an attack or effect that would deal
    slashing, piercing, or electricity damage and the ochre jelly has at least 10
    HP, the jelly splits into two identical jellies with half the original's HP. One
    jelly is in the same space as the original, and the other appears in an adjacent
    unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it automatically pushes
    creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the GM decides if an object
    or creature is too big or sturdy to push).

description: 'Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm with a sickly combination
  of yellow, orange, and brown hues. Their acidic bodies dissolve flesh but leave
  other materials, including a victim''s gear and bones, intact. Some ancient cultures
  would entomb bodies in stone sarcophaguses with ochre jellies to allow the ooze
  to break down the  flesh and clean and polish the bones.
