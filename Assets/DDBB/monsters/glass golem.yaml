description: 'Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead,
  glass golems are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems
  most often protect grand cathedrals or opulent palacesâ€”testaments to the wealth
  and power of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands
  of their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems.
  Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds
  that bleed profusely.




  Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a work
  of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature regulation
  or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem''s colorful glass construction
  can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.
