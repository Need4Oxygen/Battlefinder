  description: A spellcaster who targets a devourer with a __mental__ spell, __banishment__,
    __bind soul__, __divine decree__, __divine wrath__, __possession__, __spirit blast__,

    has trapped with Devour Soul. If this counteract attempt succeeds, the trapped
    soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the devourer can't use
    any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are otherwise immune to these spells.

description: 'When fiends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest
  reaches of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horrific undead called devourers
  that consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies
  are ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual
  transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain
  their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.
  Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cagesâ€”manifestations
  of the devourers'' most recently consumed souls.

  description: The devourer touches a creature within reach, dealing 8d6 negative
    damage (DC 31 basic Fortitude save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its
    soul becomes trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature
    can't be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a __wish__ spell. Destroying
    the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul (see Spell Deflection above)
    releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one soul at a time. A soul has 5
    soul charges per level of the originating creature (see Soul Spells below). The
    devourer can expend these charges to cast spells. If the soul is freed and the
    creature returns to life, the creature is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended.
    If reduced to 0 soul charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life
    only by powerful magic such as wish.
