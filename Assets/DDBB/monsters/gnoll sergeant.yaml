description: 'When gnolls band together to form hunting or raiding parties, the strongest
  among them is often designated the leader or sergeant. These gnolls train extensively
  in the art of war. Their skill at arms and the respect they command make them powerful
  adversaries. In smaller clans or single family units, a gnoll sergeant might also
  serve as the group''s leader in other affairs, such as sorting out domestic disputes
  or negotiating with rival gnoll clans.
