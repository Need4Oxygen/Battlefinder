description: 'Found in lost dungeons, deep caves, and abandoned mines, rust monsters
  are a bane to any adventurers who rely on armor, weapons, or other metal items.
  These strange-looking creatures grow to about 5 feet long, with four insectile legs
  and a long tail ending in a four-pronged appendage resembling a tiny windmill. However,
  it is the rust monster''s feathery antennae that strike fear in the hearts of battle-hardened
  warriors, for a single touch from even just one antenna can reduce an adventurer''s
  most valuable tools to a useless pile of rust.




  Rust monsters aren''t inherently aggressive creatures, but they''re voracious oxidivores,
  meaning they consume the rust created by their antennae. The creatures savagely
  attack anything that gets between them and a possible meal, and they relentlessly
  pursue any source of metal. A rust monster can be distracted by a single metal-rich
  item, but they are often encountered in groups of three or more, sharply raising
  the cost of escape.




  Rust monsters are a terrible scourge in mining communities. If a group of rust monsters
  discovers rich veins of ore, they can multiply quickly. By weakening tunnels, attacking
  workers, and consuming the source of the miners'' livelihood, these aberrations
  have created many mountainside ghost towns.

    If it succeeds at an antenna Strike or Disarm attempt with its antenna, the rust
    monster deals 2d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target
    is wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If the rust monster hits an unattended
    metal item, the item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses the Shield
    Block reaction with a metal shield against an antenna attack, the shield is automatically
