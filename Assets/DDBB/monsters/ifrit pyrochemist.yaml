description: 'Ifrits'' blood blazes with elemental fire. Most ifrits are second-class
  citizens who serve under the iron heel of the __efreeti__ and their Dominion of
  Flame, but those born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to flee it live
  lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.




  Ifrits are fond of fire, but this doesn''t mean they all embrace fire''s destructive
  nature. Those who seek more productive roles in a society find inspiration in the
  way flames flit and dance, and they pride themselves in their skills as acrobats
  or dancers. The church of Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit fire dancers, both
  in appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits have a safe place
  apart from their more violent kin.




  But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and callings that allow them to
  wallow in the glories of fire. Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical
  teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown or conflagration lit.
