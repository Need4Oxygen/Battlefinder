description: 'Bunyips are dangerous aquatic predators that resemble a cross between
  a shark and a seal. Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips
  hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and
  fisherfolk.




  Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with
  loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted
  by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips
  were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence
  as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local
  area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities
  are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major
  factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller
  animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to
  their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks
  with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained
  disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.




  In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum
  and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to
  the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small
  boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but
  this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.
