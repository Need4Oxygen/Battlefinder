  effect: The spriggan warlord grows to size Large, along with their equipment (which
    returns to natural size if removed). The spriggan warlord's reach increases by
    5 feet. They regain 15 Hit Points and gain a +2 status bonus to melee attack and
    damage rolls. This effect continues until the end of the spriggan warlord's next
    turn, but on any turn in which the spriggan warlord deals damage to another creature
    and is not __fatigued__, the effect extends until the end of the following turn.
    When Enraged Growth ends, the spriggan warlord is fatigued for 1 hour.

description: 'While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained
  warriors with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional
  spriggan weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional fighting
  style for its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan
  warlords often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, filling roles in spriggan
  society akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty. In smaller
  groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is typically in charge of a
  band of spriggan bullies.
