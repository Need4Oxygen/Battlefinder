  description: 60 feet. Blightburn crystals infused into an ararda's body attempt
    to __counteract__ any __teleportation__ spell moving into or out of the aura's
    emanation (counteract check +31; 7th level). In addition, any creature that starts
    its turn within the emanation is exposed to __blightburn sickness__. The aura
    is blocked by lead sheeting, 1 foot of stone, or large force effects (such as
    a __wall of force__, but not a __shield__ spell). An ararda can suppress their
    aura with an action that has the __concentrate__ trait.

  arardas. While other earth genies sparkle with the iridescence of gemstones and
  evoke the power of the earth itself, arardas use their connection to the ground
  to harness the might of electricity. Arardas are so infused with this radioactive
  crystal that their mere presence is toxic to most living creatures.
