description: 'Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst, and revel in spreading
  the same despair that brought about their mortal demise. When they aren''t blighting
  fields, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies, they experiment on prisoners
  to study how long creatures can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects
  that result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian, Horseman of Famine,
  they serve no other beings. They work alongside other daemons if Trelmarixian wills
  it, but are notoriously traitorous.
