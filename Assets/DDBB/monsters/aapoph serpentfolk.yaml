description: 'Aapophs possess greater strength and stronger venom than their zyss
  kin, but they lack zyss'' intelligence and innate magic. Unlike their selfish superiors,
  aapophs are communal and group together to hunt, wrestle, and sleep curled together
  in pits. Though they''re looked down upon and insulted by zyss, most aapophs lack
  the higher brain functions to recognize when they''re being insulted, much less
  plan or execute a rebellion. Aapophs often have unusual physical mutations—horns,
  vestigial tails, or spines protruding from their scales—yet these variations have
  little impact on their overall combat prowess— and combat prowess is the measure
  by which zyss judge them.
