description: 'Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between
  the __Shadow Plane__ and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs
  into the world of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the
  velstracsâ€” from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive
  of the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic,
  and they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights
  found in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals
  range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.
