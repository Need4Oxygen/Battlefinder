description: 'Winter wolves are related to wargs, but are larger, smarter, and far
  more dangerous. They are capable of exhaling plumes of freezing breath and are big
  enough to easily serve as mounts for orcs and hobgoblinsâ€”provided the winter wolf
  is willing, of course. Like wargs, winter wolves hunt in packs, but unlike their
  smaller cousins, they have a notable proud streak. When they deign to serve others,
  they reserve this privilege for larger and more dangerous creatures such as frost
  giants, renegade yetis, or even white dragons.
