description: 'Riding on a horse as black as night, the headless hunter known as the
  dullahan tracks down and takes the heads of those it deems unfit to continue living.
  When closing in for the kill, the dullahan first whispers its victim''s name, then
  swiftly collects its prize, casting a pall of dread upon all who witness the grim
  execution.




  A dullahan manifests when a particularly violent warrior is beheaded and the warrior''s
  soul stubbornly clings to material existence (or is refused entry to the afterlife).
  Most dullahans return to their former homelands, where they can exact vengeance
  those they feel wronged them in life (or their living descendants). A dullahan''s
  concept of justice is swift and merciless, and once it has selected a target, it
  is unwavering in its cause.




  Perhaps even more than revenge on the living, a dullahan desires its own rotted
  head. An individual who wields the head of a dullahan is powerful indeed, for a
  dullahan will grudgingly serve such a master in the hopes of reclaiming its missing
  skull. Mighty fiends such as devils command dullahans to harvest souls or lead armies
  for them, while a mortal might use such an undead warrior to fulfill a personal
  vendetta. No matter its master''s rank or station, however, a dullahan won''t hesitate
  to kill its liege and reclaim its head when the opportunity presents itself.




  Most dullahan lairs are abandoned, overgrown ruins or other dilapidated places where
  severed heads and other trophies line the walls. Some dullahans, on the other hand,
  are content to simply commit their foul deeds and leave the remains of their decapitated
  victims in the streets, strewn among a copse of dead trees, or unceremoniously tossed
  in a bog hole.
