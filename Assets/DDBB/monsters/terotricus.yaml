description: 'The legendary terotricus is a massive slime-mold that hails from the
  Abyss. Its collective consciousness encapsulates entire regions, spreading as far
  as its ever-growing cloud of spores will take it. Once it has seeped onto the Material
  Plane from the Abyssal realm, a terotricus''s agenda is to feed on all living creatures,
  infecting them with its spores, and its presence can spell doom for any in its way.




  Terotricuses move by rapidly expanding and contracting their slimy "bodies," which
  are capable of burrowing through soil, gliding across water, and scrabbling up steep
  slopes. These behemoths of rot don''t need to travel to see their plans come to
  fruition, though; their spores easily latch onto demons and other denizens of the
  Abyss, who in turn bring this blight to the Material Plane when the fiends are summoned.




  When a terotricus infects a creature with its spores, web-like fungal growths start
  appearing on the victim''s skin until they cover the entire body, at which point
  the victim''s mind is also subdued and bent to the terotricus''s will. The terotricus''s
  favored victims include animals, elves, and fey, though it is happy to infect any
  creature it can catch. Cults of Treerazer occasionally attempt to make contact with
  a terotricus, but such acts almost always simply result in a new sect of spore-blighted
  slaves.
