description: 'Aboleths form the core of alghollthu society, and while they are the
  "common folk" of their own societies, they see themselves as masters of all others.
  Unlike their leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel
  in their monstrous forms, appearing as primeval fish with tentacles. Masters of
  psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the
  world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet.
  They see all other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea
  that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages
  aboleths.
