description: 'While manta rays might appear daunting, they are generally docile. Manta
  rays are found in temperate or tropical oceans, and they generally stay in the upper
  reaches or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are filter feeders that subsist
  on plankton. They can also eat larger fish or aquatic creatures as the need arises,
  but rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater cultures, particularly
  aquatic elves, raise and farm manta rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden,
  or even pets. Manta rays don''t make particularly good mounts, but some aquatic
  civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.
