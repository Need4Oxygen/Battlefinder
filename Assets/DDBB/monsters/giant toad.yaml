description: 'Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and
  eagerly eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They''re known to eat giant
  rats, then take over the rats'' burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison
  glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This leads
  to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly explode if
  left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests, some groups of
  __ogres__ and __hill giants__ cultivate them to collect their poison for recreational
  use.
