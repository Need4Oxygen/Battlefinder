description: '__Hell''s__ armies contain legions upon legions of different devils
  all suited precisely to their roles. But such an army needs able commanders, and
  it is this role that cornugons fill. Their mere presence inspires those under their
  command to improved performance— often through fear of the horrible torments that
  a cornugon can unleash as punishment for failure. Forged in the fires of Malebolge
  from the most renowned warriors among lesser devilkind, even the least cornugon
  is among the fiercest warriors of the multiverse. The greatest among them on occasion
  ascend further still, becoming those rare and feared legends of Hell called malebranche.
