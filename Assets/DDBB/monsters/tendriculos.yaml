description: 'These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form
  where the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries.
  Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled forest
  paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey as quickly
  as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices finish the meal, while swiftly
  restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature. When collected,
  neutralized, and refined, the digestive fluids of a tendriculos form a lacquer that
  retains some of the tendriculos''s acid resistance.




  A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the __Sylvan__
  language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different tongue, such as
  __Aklo__, __Draconic__, or even __Necril__. Regardless, tendriculoses have little
  patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined fey and primal
  spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with tendriculoses.
  Befriending a tendriculos requires great patience and plentiful foodâ€”and these the
  gifts of food must be alive when handed over.




  When it has finished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into a quiescent
  state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach. Upon rousing,
  it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible portions of its meal.
  These remains may contain valuables that survived digestion and indicate that a
  tendriculos''s hunting grounds lie nearby.




  Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near populated areas soon
  draw unwanted attention with their ravenous appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop
  fruiting bodies that cast forth millions of spores. Spores that happen to alight
  on carrion grow into new tendriculoses.
