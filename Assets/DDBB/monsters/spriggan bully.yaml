  effect: The spriggan bully grows to Large size, along with their equipment (which
    returns to natural size if removed). The spriggan bully's reach increases by 5
    feet. They regain 5 Hit Points and gain a +2 status bonus to melee attacks and
    damage rolls. This effect continues until the end of the spriggan bully's next
    turn, but on any turn in which the spriggan bully deals damage to another creature
    and is not __fatigued__, the effect extends until the end of the following turn.
    When Enraged Growth ends, the spriggan bully is fatigued for 1 hour.

description: 'The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in
  fights, but only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment,
  tease, and abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inflict the maximum
  amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying prisoners
  or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching others fight,
  and fighting among themselves.
