description: 'Shining children are wicked, enigmatic monsters that roam remote planes
  and untraveled corners of the universe in search of esoteric lore. With their abnormally
  gaunt frames, long white hair, and unnerving, four-fingered hands, shining children
  are both strangely familiar and otherworldly in appearance, though they are barely
  visible within the shroud of blinding light they continually emit. Their faces are
  truly horrible, however, as their overlarge eyes and distended, gaping mouths reveal
  their heads to be voids filled with unnatural light. Shining children use this light
  as a weapon, weaving illusions and focusing beams of fiery brilliance.




  Because of their reputation as scholars of the alien and the eldritch, shining children
  are sometimes summoned by powerful wizards or occultists in search of rare knowledge.
  The creatures never give away their lore without some price, though, and typically
  demand in return the performance of contemptible deeds that further their inscrutable,
  far-ranging plans.




  These mysterious beings are natives of the Astral Plane. In that vast plane, accretions
  of metaphysical matter gradually accumulate and eventually coalesce into demiplanes.
  During this tumultuous process, sparks of living light sometimes shear off the newly
  formed planes, and these sparks of raw planar energy somehow transform into shining
  children. Every newly formed demiplane leaves a different mental imprint on its
  shining "offspring," making it easy for shining children to telepathically recognize
  their brothers and sisters. Forever trapped in apparently adolescent bodies, shining
  children dedicate themselves to scholarship and violence with equal measure in a
  futile effort to understand their roles in the multiverse and the burning injustice
  of their births.




  Shining children confuse most other creatures with their refusal to use individual
  names in favor of alternating between referring to each other singularly and collectively.
