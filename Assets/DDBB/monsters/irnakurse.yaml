description: 'Irnakurse are surface elves who __drow__ have subjected to particularly
  cruel and humiliating fleshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the
  torment of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves
  twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose flesh,
  and bony protrusionsâ€”parts that should be internal are often left on full display
  to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to hate
  their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all other
  targets.
