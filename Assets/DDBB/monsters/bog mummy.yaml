description: 'The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body
  can become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading
  undead monstrosities.




  Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever, leave their
  marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artificially preserved kin,
  bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals but by the natural
  elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or muddy swamp. While
  corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from the mire as bog mummies
  as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed influence of a necromancer,
  the vast majority of them animate from a seething need for vengeance or to pursue
  some dire agenda left unfinished at the time of deathâ€”often because the creature
  was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of this emotional tie to life and the
  emotional power of the deceased compel unlife beyond death, while the preservative
  qualities of the bog within which the body was disposed of does the rest.




  Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill their dark yearnings
  with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the living, they mercilessly
  attack any living creatures that dare to venture into their dismal domains. Their
  agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away most natural life dwelling
  therein and often alerting travelers to the potential danger that lies beneath the
  surface.'
