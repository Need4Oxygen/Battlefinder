description: 'Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways
  in search of appealing fish to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive,
  emaciated fey calls every living creature a "fish." Only other fey are exempt, and
  they tend to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never find satisfaction.
  Each time they catch a fish, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing
  spot to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace.
  By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.




  A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things
  with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen
  is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather.
  Capturing a "fish" gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers
  and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.
