description: 'A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to serve
  as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter first begins to study the
  art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since the creation
  process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator''s
  own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the
  homunculus to gain a spark of the creator''s intellect, as well as the same moral
  values and some of the creator''s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their
  own devices never stray far from their masters.




  In most cases, a homunculus doesn''t survive the death of its master for long. Deprived
  of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly self-destructive,
  and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely, a homunculus with
  a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as
  its deceased creator''s child or successor and attempting to further its creator''s
  legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity
  to its master upon that creature''s death, a portion of the dead master''s soul
  "infects" the surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn''t
  result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the
  soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater
  personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to
  speak. Over time, a few of these "awakened" homunculi even go so far as to become
  convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their
  actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living
  creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become
  awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might
  pursue studies in its creator''s class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities
  of that class if time and fortune permit.




  Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water,
  and a pint of the creator''s own blood. It is possible for a separate donor to provide
  the blood, but the process is more difficult.

    It can share information back and forth, including its master's knowledge and

    adopts the same alignment as its creator and is utterly faithful. If the homunculus

    homunculus becomes mindless, claims its current location as its lair, and instinctively
    attacks anyone who comes near.
