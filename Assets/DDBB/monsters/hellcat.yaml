description: 'Hellcats are devious predators native to the fiery pits of Hell. While
  the fiendish creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat
  and dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn
  with transparent flesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is
  9 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.




  Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time huntingâ€”that is, seeking and
  stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As fiendish creatures, they do not
  require mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure
  of inflicting pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they
  resent being treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one
  may find themself made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths
  to coordinate elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.




  Though they can''t speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate by telepathy
  with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much except to make whispered
  threats and to acknowledge the orders of their diabolic masters.




  Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up against foes
  they''re unable to reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them. They often
  track potential victims and recruit allies, including other hellcats, to make coordinated
  attacks or ambushes against their foes.
