description: 'An immortal ichor is an intelligent mass of blood from a dead evil deity.
  The cultists who perform the ritual to create immortal ichor typically seal up the
  sentient ooze in an underground or remote chamber that blocks its magical abilities,
  but over time these seals break or weaken, freeing the unholy monster.

  description: A creature that fails to save against an immortal ichor's __charm__
    spell becomes __stupefied 1__. The stupefied value reduces by 1 every 24 hours.
    The first time each day a creature stupefied by the ichor's charm fails to save
    against another casting of the ichor's charm, the value of the condition increases
    by 1d4. If the stupefied condition ever equals the creature's Wisdom score, it
    becomes __controlled__ by the ichor permanently; if it dies, it rises the next
    round as a __zombie__ (of the GM's choice) under the ichor's control. If the ichor
    is killed, these zombies are destroyed.
