description: 'Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled
  together from scraps of firewood and discarded burls. It''s less common for wood
  golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved
  in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners.
  While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly
  carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection
  and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don''t bother. Druids and creatures
  who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront
  or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion
  or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians
  for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem''s
  appearance and such locations.
