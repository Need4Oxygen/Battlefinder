description: 'The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human
  with a penchant for feasting on human flesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with
  large quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore flings at prey by whipping
  its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter
  even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.




  Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect, most
  creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars, however,
  and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many unwitting travelers
  into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated humanoids (especially those
  who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become the center of adoration and even
  worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly gives in to its laziness and allows
  its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of food and treasure, feasting upon
  its own followers when offerings become scarce. Stronger humanoids who encounter
  a manticore can cow it through intimidation and violence, sometimes even forcing
  it into service as a mount. As long as the manticore is well fed with human flesh
  and its master leads it to victory, a manticore mount can prove surprisingly loyal.

  description: 'The manticore flings up to two spikes from its tail, targeting either
