description: 'The kingdoms of the cyclopes date to an age before the rise of humanity,
  when dragons and giants and serpentfolk ruled the world. The cyclopes built enormous
  stone cities and prayed to ancient gods of brutality and wrath, but their power
  to foresee the future failed them, and their civilization collapsed. Today, most
  cyclopes have virtually no knowledge of the former glory of their kind, even though
  it is not uncommon for them to dwell among the ruins of their greatness. Cyclops
  cities include monuments and imposing murals which depict their peoples'' history,
  but few now among them can read or interpret these relics of the past.




  In addition to their single eye, cyclopes are also famous for their never-ending
  hunger, an appetite so all-consuming that some scholars theorize it may in fact
  be some kind of curse. The ever-present hunger of the cyclopes seems to have some
  connection to the death of their civilizationâ€”though whether this voracity was the
  cause or a side-effect of their people''s downfall is likely destined to remain
  a mystery.




  Although details of the cyclopes'' gods have largely been lost to the annals of
  time, what little is known about these deities suggests they were vindictive and
  petty enough to curse their own people if they felt neglected or badly served.
