description: 'Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair,
  medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can permanently
  transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who
  collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears of
  weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic
  to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society
  to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful
  organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal out  ts and thieves'' guilds,
  and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles
  who offer to help adventurers find what they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit
  and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate
  stone decorations with little more than a glare.




  Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict
  even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the
  effects of a medusa''s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures
  are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows
  from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain,
  and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth
  sparing the monster''s life.
