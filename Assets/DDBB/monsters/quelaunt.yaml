description: 'This three-armed, three-legged monster has no discernible eyes, nose,
  ears, or mouth or no visible means of ingesting food. Its limbs are distributed
  so evenly across its body that it is all but impossible to tell which way the creature
  is oriented at any given time. Few who witness the quelaunt linger on its alien
  looks for long though, as the most pressing concern quickly becomes the invasion
  of their minds, as the quelaunt sows doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not
  only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength
  and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel
  to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt
  feasts.




  Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain collectors
  and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However, the more
  prevalent theory paints them as more alien—perhaps invasive beings from another
  dimension of pure thought and feeling—and claims that in their natural state they
  have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy
  of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher''s suicide just days afterward and all
  the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked
  in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant
  great protection from quelaunts, even after death.
