description: "Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively\
  \ as runelordsâ€”each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn\
  \ was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone\
  \ on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn't long before the technique used\
  \ to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each\
  \ tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn\
  \ of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a\
  \ vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn\
  \ generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade\
  \ legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn's\
  \ bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their\
  \ flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for\
  \ a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing\
  \ pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue.\
  \ Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human\
  \ of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and\
  \ have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn's\
  \ veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the\
  \ rest of their kin.\n\n## Sinspawn Sins\n\n When a sinspawn is created, it becomes\
  \ associated with one of the seven sins: envoy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth,\
  \ or wrath. A sinspawn's sin is determined by the runewell that spawned it or by\
  \ its creator's preferred sin, and cannot be changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated\
  \ with it additional benefits and abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn\
  \ stat block, as detailed below.\n\n## Envyspawn\n\n An envyspawn has Deception\
  \ +7 and typically carries a halberd. They tend to be shorter and thinner than other\
  \ sinspawn.\n\n**Melee**  halberd +10 (__reach 10 feet__, __versatile S__), **Damage**\
  \ 1d10+4 piercing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves\
  \ against an envyspawn's sinful bite are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. \n\n## Gluttonyspawn\n\
  \n A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese,\
  \ but hardy and strong.\n\n**Melee**  scythe +10 (__deadly d10__, __trip__), **Damage**\
  \ 1d10+4 slashing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves\
  \ against a gluttonyspawn's sinful bite are drained 1. \n\n## Greedspawn\n\n A greedspawn\
  \ has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive. They are the tallest of sinspawn,\
  \ often 7 feet in height, and with gold-tinged veins.\n\n**Melee**  glaive +10 (__deadly\
  \ d8__, __forceful__, __reach 10 feet__), **Damage** 1d8+4 slashing\n\n**Sinful\
  \ Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a greedspawn's sinful\
  \ bite are clumsy 2 for 1 minute. \n\n## Lustspawn\n\n A lustspawn has Diplomacy\
  \ +7 and usually carries a guisarme. They have attractive bodies, but hideous faces.\n\
  \n**Melee**  guisarme +10 (__reach 10 feet__, __trip__), **Damage** 1d10+4 slashing\n\
  \n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against a lustspawn's\
  \ sinful bite are stupefied 2 for 1 minute. \n\n## Pridespawn\n\n A pridespawn has\
  \ Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly skeletal in their gauntness,\
  \ and often seek out fine clothes or jewelry to wear, taking strange pleasure in\
  \ appearing elegant and regal.\n\n**Melee**  maul +10 (__shove__), **Damage** 1d12+4\
  \ bludgeoning\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically fail their saves against\
  \ a pridespawn's sinful bite are clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. \n\n## Slothspawn\n\
  \n A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess\
  \ skin drape the slothspawn's hunched frame.\n\n**Melee**  longspear +10 (__reach\
  \ 10 feet__), **Damage** 1d8+4 piercing\n\n**Sinful Bite** Creatures that critically\
  \ fail their saves against a slothspawn's sinful bite take a -10-foot status penalty\
  \ to their Speeds for 1 minute. \n\n## Wrathspawn\n\n The most commonly encountered\
  \ of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur.\
  \ These sinspawn are the bulkiest looking of their kind.\n\n**Melee**  ranseur +\
  \ 10 (__disarm__, __reach 10 feet__), **Damage** 1d10+4 piercing\n\n**Sinful Bite**\
  \ Creatures that critically fail their saves against a wrathspawn's sinful bite\
  \ are drained 1 as well as enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge\
