description: 'Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also
  known as faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate
  settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders,
  causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and
  eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend
  alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic
  masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless
  stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed goals without the
  guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the sea
  coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most dwell
  in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns.




  By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in humanoid
  societies, then guide infiltrated settlements down paths of destruction. Among humanoids
  who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become a prominent trailblazer,
  leading a group to new heights of depravity and violence. Inevitably, however, faceless
  stalker infiltrators lead their followers to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves
  on—either because its true nature is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled
  or devastated all local resources.




  An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking tongue. Their prey
  bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major arteries. Corpses bearing such
  marks are typically the first clues found to uncover a faceless stalker''s presence,
  though sometimes they are overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.
