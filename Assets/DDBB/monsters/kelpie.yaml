description: 'Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring
  mortals to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water,
  slightly preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater
  then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim''s heart and liverâ€” the
  only parts of a meal kelpies find unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically disguising
  itself as fine steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but its true appearance
  takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green flesh resembling aquatic plants.
