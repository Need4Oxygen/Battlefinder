description: 'Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping of herbivorous dinosaurs that share
  characteristic flat snouts filled with rows of grinding teeth well suited for feeding
  on vegetation. Also known as "duck-billed dinosaurs" due to the unusual shape of
  their jaws, hadrosaurids are lumbering creatures that can rival an elephant for
  size, although they tend to be much less aggressive and are prone to flight when
  confronted with danger rather than stubbornly standing their ground. Many species
  of hadrosaurids have uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each species
  its own unusual profile, making them easily recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur
  watcher.




  Giants and other oversized creatures have been known to domesticate hadrosaurids
  to serve as livestock. Despite their ability to sprint quickly, they don''t make
  particularly viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group, a panicked
  gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak great damage with their trampling.




  A hadrosaurid can walk for short distances on its hind legs but prefers to graze
  and travel on all fours. The typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30 feet long and can weigh
  up to 10,000 pounds.
