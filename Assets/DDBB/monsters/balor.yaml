description: "When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision\
  \ is the balor—a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with\
  \ a flaming whip and a sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim.\
  \ On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically\
  \ command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest\
  \ mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can\
  \ fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens\
  \ of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life. \n\n## Balor Lords\n\n\
  \ Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually\
  \ transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord.\
  \ These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who\
  \ rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into\
  \ a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of\
  \ a true demon lord.\n\n\n\n**__Recall Knowledge - Fiend__ (__Religion__)**: DC\
