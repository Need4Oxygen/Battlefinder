description: 'Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their
  kind. In most other calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known
  as the Forsaken merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep
  and terrible hunger. Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek
  to feed on others with their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger
  sated. Slayers denied the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually,
  murderous rage.




  Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience.
  Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer''s hunger appears at the moment of
  their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent,
  lightless implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis'' deaths,
  consuming the body itself in a final attempt at satiation.




  Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe
  with ill-concealed envy at the position of power __caligni stalkers__ occupy, ever
  scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own. For their part, stalkers
  tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the talents slayers contribute
  to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too ambitious can become a brave
  sacrifice in battle, for the good of the enclave. In physical stature, slayers fall
  between the willowy __caligni dancers__ and the diminutive __creepers__. Stalkers
  tower above most slayersâ€”yet another source of slayers'' envy and resentment.
