description: 'Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell''s armies,
  using their superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell''s
  influence throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation
  of strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise
  only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to the
  pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of outstanding
  skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to a contest of strategy,
  typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a dispute. In the unlikely
  event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to great lengths to later
  obtain that mortal''s services for their own infernal ends.
