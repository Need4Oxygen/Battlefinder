description: 'While many xulgaths impose their will by strength or sheer numbers,
  some resort to more nefarious—and grotesque—means to take care of matters. The bilebearer
  takes its name from its eponymous bile, a putrid substance that oozes from gill-like
  folds in its colorful, bulging neck. Bilebearers coat their weapons with the viscous
  substance or secrete a concentrated dose that suffuses the air around them and disables
  foes.




  A bilebearer''s neck bulges with folds of scaled flesh that extend almost to the
  creature''s shoulders, containing its namesake bile productions glands inside. These
  folds expand and contract with each breath, and each fold has a vertical line of
  muscled pores that gradually exudes the thick substance, providing a perpetual supply
  for coating weapons. Bilebearers'' necks also contain inflatable bladders, which
  they can quickly pressurize to expel a blast of vaporized bile in a noxious, overwhelming
  cloud.




  Bilebearers serve their clutches by kidnapping or slaying specific enemies. They
  frequently accompany their kin, particularly xulgath skulkers, to raid rival clutches
  or intercept foes. A bilebearer''s mode of attack typically involves sneaking in,
  overwhelming any guards with a noxious blast of bile, and then turning their attention
  to the primary target. The xulgath either shreds the rapidly weakening victim on
  the spot or drags them away for future violence.
