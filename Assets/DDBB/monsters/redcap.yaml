description: 'Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and
  murder. While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap
  women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed
  by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise
  the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power
  from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to
  these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their
  metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcertingâ€” especially
  to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3
  feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled
  hair.
