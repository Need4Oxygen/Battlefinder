  description: If exposed to direct sunlight, a cavern troll immediately becomes __slowed
    1__ and can't use reactions or Trample. The slowed value increases by 1 each time
    the cavern troll ends its turn in sunlight. If the cavern troll's actions are
    reduced to 0 in this way, they become __petrified__ until they spends at least
    1 minute in darkness. Spells like __sunburst__ that create magical sunlight cannot
    petrify a cavern troll, but the troll is slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds after being exposed
    to such an effect.

description: 'Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom of the Darklands, cavern
  trolls consume all in their pathâ€”even rocks and minerals when more nourishing sustenance
  is scarce. These rocky goliaths can tunnel through stone with their iron-sharp claws.


  Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating
  vulnerability to sunlight that petrifies them on sustained contact. Unlike common
  trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by fire. The crystalline nature
  of their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.


  As cavern trolls age, their flinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and
  stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete with
  large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and weighs
  about 2,000 pounds.'
