description: 'A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the
  froghemoth is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most
  remote Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is
  a frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only
  its eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.
