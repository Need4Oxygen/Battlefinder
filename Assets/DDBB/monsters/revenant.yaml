description: 'Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders
  and are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers. The common wisdom
  is that revenants arise only from individuals who have been utterly betrayed or
  abandoned to die a grueling death, but even then such victims might not rise from
  their graves. In other cases, revenants might even rise from what might legitimately
  be considered an accident if the revenant doesn''t understand the full circumstances
  of their demise. In such cases, it doesn''t matter that the "murderer" may not have
  intended to kill, for revenants understands no pity and can never forgive. Revenants
  have little memory of their lives other than anything they might need to recall
  in order to achieve their goal of vengeance.
