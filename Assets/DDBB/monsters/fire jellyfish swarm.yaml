description: 'While individually one of these fist-sized jellyfish is merely a nuisance,
  in great numbers, fire jellyfish can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the
  water, they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their
  bright coloration, but those who are stung by fire jellyfish learn the larger reason
  for their nameâ€”the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.
