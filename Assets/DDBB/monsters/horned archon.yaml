description: 'Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling
  the Outer Sphere''s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities
  safe from demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head,
  horns, and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially
  Erastil, they journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas,
  secretly performing acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost
  children, and driving off evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana
  and Elysium, horned archons are among the best at understanding the perspectives
  of other celestials.
