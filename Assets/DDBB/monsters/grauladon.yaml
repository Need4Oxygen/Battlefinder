description: 'Grauladons are vicious predators that appear crocodilian in form, but
  are in fact distant offshoots of dragonkind. They make their dens in the shallows
  of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural swamps
  or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons spend
  most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as fish or
  waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins, grauladons
  often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the corpses to keep
  scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is 16 feet long from
  its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds.




  A grauladon''s stench may seem supernaturally disgusting, but it is simply the result
  of the creature''s fetid habitat and diet of rotting, waterlogged meat. As grauladons''
  exhalations bear a passing resemblance to dragons'' breath, they have earned the
  nickname "mud drakes" from rural folk.




  Grauladons can be found in both fresh and brackish water in most temperate climates.
  They prefer to lair in shallow waters, particularly where reeds or other foliage
  conceal their bulk from unsuspecting prey. Grauladons are highly territorial and
  won''t tolerate other predators living or hunting near their homes.
