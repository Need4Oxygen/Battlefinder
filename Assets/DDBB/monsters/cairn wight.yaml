description: 'Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually
  spawn from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought of
  separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered by transformation
  into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently, particularly avaricious
  and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to transform into cairn wights
  to guard their precious wealth for all time.


  Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to spontaneously
  transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the intercession of a
  powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant wight exhibits
  unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed.


  As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to the
  armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread their
  necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn wight''s sword
  channels life from the victim into the wight.
