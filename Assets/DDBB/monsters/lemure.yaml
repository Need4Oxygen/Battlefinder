description: 'These shapeless masses of quivering flesh are the least of devilkind.
  Pathetic creatures from Hell''s first layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering
  souls. Pit fiends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their
  collective wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and
  transforming it into a more powerful devil (see the pit fiend''s Devil Shaping ability).

    the lemure's sight, a new command is issued by the same or another devil, or the
