description: 'Arboreal regents and other wielders of powerful primal magic grant temporary
  sentience to trees in order to protect the forest. Invested with a workable set
  of instincts and the ability to mobilize and attack, these awakened trees follow
  the commands of their master and fight to protect their home. The statistics below
  work just as well for foliage that has become animate via other methods, such as
  a mystical influence from another dimension, a capricious fey spirit, or the like.
