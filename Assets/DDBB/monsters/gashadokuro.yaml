description: 'The dreaded gashadokuro is an undead haunter of the night, a giant skeleton
  that rises from the earth in the aftermath of a mass starvation event and seeks
  to inflict its unending hunger on the living.




  A gashadokuro that comes about due to a poor growing season is more prone to stalk
  remote village farmlands at night, while a gashadokuro that arose from the victims
  of a government-instigated food shortage has few compunctions about stomping straight
  into bustling cities in broad daylight. These latter gashadokuro even seem to target
  aristocrats and government authorities—whether or not they are the same politicians
  whose negligence resulted in the famine in the first place—leading many to believe
  that the gashadokuro seeks to slake its thirst for revenge even more than it seeks
  to sate its unending hunger.
