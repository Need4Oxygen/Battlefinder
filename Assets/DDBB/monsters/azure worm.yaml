description: 'The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in flooded
  tunnels than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to lie
  in wait within the walls, door, or even ceiling of flooded caverns, ready to spring
  out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm is particularly
  hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact that an azure worm
  that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from the submerged river
  or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an azure worm is near a Darklands
  settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing a hunting party to deal with the
  menace before it can bring ruin.
