- descr: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its
    AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage
    to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including
    extra dice for its potency rune, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses
    or other additional dice apply to this damage.

- descr: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck
    to that surface by the missile. The target is immobilized and must spend an Interact
    action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move
    from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesnâ€™t become stuck if it is incorporeal,
    is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without
    effort.
