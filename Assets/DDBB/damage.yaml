- descr: 'Damage dealt by weapons, many physical hazards, and a handful of spells
    is collectively called physical damage. The main types of physical damage are
    bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. **Bludgeoning damage** comes from weapons
    and hazards that deal blunt-force trauma, like a hit from a club or being dashed
    against rocks. **Piercing damage** is dealt from stabs and punctures, whether
    from a dragon’s fangs or the thrust of a spear. **Slashing damage** is delivered
    by a cut, be it the swing of the sword or the blow from a scythe blades trap.


    Ghosts and other incorporeal creatures have a high resistance to physical attacks
    that aren’t magical (attacks that lack the magical trait). Furthermore, most incorporeal
    creatures have additional, though lower, resistance to magical physical damage
    (such as damage dealt from a mace with the magic trait) and most other damage
    types.'

- descr: 'Many spells and other magical effects deal energy damage. Energy damage
    is also dealt from effects in the world, such as the biting cold of a blizzard
    to a raging forest fire. The main types of energy damage are acid, cold, electricity,
    fire, and sonic. **Acid damage** can be delivered by gases, liquids, and certain
    solids that dissolve flesh, and sometimes by harder materials. **Cold damage**
    freezes material by way of contact with chilling gases and ice. **Electricity
    damage** comes from the discharge of powerful lightning and sparks. **Fire damage**
    burns through heat and combustion. **Sonic damage** assaults matter with high-frequency
    vibration and sound waves. Many times, you deal energy damage by casting magic
    spells, and doing so is often useful against creatures that have immunities or
    resistances to physical damage.


    Two special types of energy damage specifically target the living and the undead.
    Positive energy often manifests as healing energy to living creatures but can
    create **positive damage** that withers undead bodies and disrupts and injures
    incorporeal undead. Negative energy often revivifies the unnatural, unliving power
    of undead, while manifesting as **negative damage** that gnaws at the living.


    Powerful and pure magical energy can manifest itself as **force damage**. Few
    things can resist this type of damage—not even incorporeal creatures such as ghosts
    and wraiths.'

- descr: Weapons and effects keyed to a particular alignment can deal **chaotic**,
    **evil**, **good**, or **lawful** damage. These damage types apply only to creatures
    that have the opposing alignment trait. Chaotic damage harms only lawful creatures,
    evil damage harms only good creatures, good damage harms only evil creatures,
    and lawful damage harms only chaotic creatures.

- descr: Sometimes an effect can target the mind with enough psychic force to actually
    deal damage to the creature. When it does, it deals **mental damage**. Mindless
    creatures and those with only programmed or rudimentary intelligence are often
    immune to mental damage and effects.

- descr: Venoms, toxins, and the like can deal **poison damage**, which affects creatures
    by way of contact, ingestion, innhalation, or injury, In addition to coming from
    monster attacks, alchemical items, and spells, poison damage is often caused by
    ongoing afflictions, which follow special rules described on page 457.

- descr: Another special type of physical damage is **bleed damage**. This is persistent
    damage that represents loss of blood. As such, it has no effect on nonliving creatures
    or living creatures that don’t need blood to live. Weaknesses and resistances
    to physical damage apply.

- descr: 'Sometimes you are able to make the most of your attack through sheer precision.
    When you hit with an ability that grants you **precision damage**, you increase
    the attack’s listed damage, using the same damage type, rather than tracking a
    separate pool of damage. For example, a non-magical dagger Strike that deals 1d6
    precision damage from a rogue’s sneak attack increases the piercing damage by
    1d6.


    Some creatures are immune to precision damage, regardless of the damage type;
    these are often amorphous creatures that lack vulnerable anatomy. A creature immune
    to precision damage would ignore the 1d6 precision damage in the example above,
    but it would still take the rest of the piercing damage from the Strike. Likewise,
    since precision damage is always the same type of damage as the attack it’s augmenting,
    a creature that is resistant to non-magical damage, like a ghost or other incorporeal
    creature, would resist not only the dagger’s damage but also the precision damage,
    even though it is not specifically resistant to precision damage.'

- descr: While not their own damage category, precious materials can modify damage
    to penetrate a creature’s resistances or take advantage of its weaknesses. For
    instance, silver weapons are particularly effective against lycanthropes and bypass
    the resistances to physical damage that most devils have.
